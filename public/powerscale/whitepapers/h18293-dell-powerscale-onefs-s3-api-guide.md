Executive summary

4 Dell PowerScale: OneFS S3 API Guide
Executive summary

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) provides a set of APIs that enable
applications to access object storage. With the popularity of S3 object storage, more
storage vendors are implementing their own object-storage engines with S3-compatible
APIs. However, some Amazon S3 APIs are designed specifically for Amazon Web
Services (AWS), with example services including life cycle management, charging, and
analytics. Third-party S3-compatible storage usually implements a subset of Amazon S3
official APIs to enable object access.
Starting with Dell EMC™ OneFS™ version 9.0, Dell PowerScale™ introduces the
capability of data access by exposing the compatible S3 APIs. To facilitate administration
and application deployment with the OneFS S3 implementation, this document shows
how OneFS S3 API compatibility compares with the latest version of the Amazon S3 API.

OneFS S3 API compatibility overview

Dell PowerScale: OneFS S3 API Guide

OneFS S3 API compatibility overview

The Amazon S3 API was originally developed as the data-access interface of Amazon S3.
As applications were developed using the S3 API, it became a common standard for
object storage. This document refers to the S3 API for object storage as the S3 protocol.
This provides a consistent nomenclature along with other NAS protocols regarding the
OneFS file service.
Starting with OneFS 9.0, PowerScale OneFS supports the Amazon S3 protocol with
OneFS S3, an object-storage interface that is compatible with the Amazon S3 API.
OneFS S3 enables access to file-based data that is stored on OneFS clusters as objects.
This section compares OneFS S3 API compatibility with the Amazon S3 official APIs.
OneFS supports both path-style requests and virtual hosted-style requests. It uses port
9020 for HTTP and port 9021 for HTTPS by default.
Table 1 lists the latest versions of AWS S3 APIs (sourced from Amazon S3 API
documentation), and shows the compatibility with OneFS S3. See section 2 and section 3
for details about each OneFS supported S3 API. The APIs are sorted alphabetically as in
the Amazon S3 API documentation.

OneFS S3 Object Lock
Amazon S3 Object Lock helps prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a
specified retention period or indefinitely using a write-once-read-many (WORM) storage
model. This feature is commonly used to meet regulatory compliance requirements that
mandate WORM storage, or to provide an additional layer of protection against accidental
## Additional
features

OneFS S3 supported object APIs

## 35
Dell PowerScale: OneFS S3 API Guide

or malicious data modification or deletion. For more information about S3 Object Lock,
refer to AWS S3 Object Lock documentation.
Starting with OneFS 9.12, the OneFS S3 service introduces support for S3 Object Lock,
implemented on top of the OneFS SmartLock feature within the file system. OneFS S3
Object Lock supports both object-level (Object Lock) and bucket-level (Bucket Lock)
locking semantics.
Bucket-Level Locking (Bucket Lock)
- Bucket-level locking enables all objects within the bucket to inherit a default
retention policy.
- Once enabled, bucket lock mode cannot be disabled.
- The retention period (in days or years) is applied dynamically to each object,
starting from the time it is committed to the file system.
- Modifying the bucket’s retention policy updates the retention settings for all objects
in the bucket.
- Reducing the retention period of the bucket is a privileged operation and requires
the ISI_PRIV_IFS_WORM_DELETE permission.
- In a Bucket Lock configuration, all objects are locked, and objects can only be
deleted after their retention period has expired.
Object-Level Locking (Object Lock)
- Object-level locking allows setting individual retention periods at the time an object
is committed.
- The Default retention can be specified in days or years from the object’s commit
time.
- The retention date of individual objects within the bucket can be modified. Modifying
the retention date to a shorter value requires the IFSI_PRIV_IFS_WORM_DELETE
privilege.
- A privileged deletion is allowed for locked objects before their expiry date. This
requires the ISI_PRIV_IFS_WORM_DELETE privilege.
By integrating S3 Object Lock with OneFS SmartLock, OneFS provides a robust,
compliant storage solution for customers requiring WORM capabilities using S3, either for
regulatory adherence or for enhanced data protection.
Note: OneFS S3 Object Lock does not support legal hold and compliance retention mode.
OneFS S3 server access logging
Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a
bucket. Server access logs are useful for many applications. For example, accessing log
information can be useful in security and access audits. Please refer to AWS S3 Server
Access Logging documentation for more details.

OneFS S3 supported object APIs

36 Dell PowerScale: OneFS S3 API Guide
Starting with OneFS 9.12, the OneFS S3 service introduces support for S3 server access
logging. When you enable access logging on a bucket, you need to specify a target
bucket to store the logs file along with a log file prefix.
OneFS supports to use object lock enabled bucket as the server access log target bucket.
The target bucket must have the WRITE ACL/ FULL_CONTROL permission granted to
the source bucket owner. Additionally, the source bucket owner should ensure that the
OneFS ACL permissions are appropriately configured for the target bucket directory.
Failure to properly configure these permissions causes the logging configuration to fail.
Log object key format
The log object key format supports date-based partitioning, offering a more hierarchical
and structured layout that simplifies troubleshooting and significantly reduces the risk of
exceeding S3’s object limits under a single prefix. Compared to non-date-based
partitioning, this approach improves both operational scalability and data manageability.
Please refer to AWS S3 Log Object Key Format documentation for more information. The
OneFS log object key format follows the structure:
[DestinationPrefix][ZoneId]/[UserId]/[SourceBucket]/[YYYY]/[MM]/[D
D]/[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[hh]-[mm]-[ss]-[UniqueString]
An example log object shown below, where DestinationPrefix=bkt01-log, ZoneId=1, and
UserId=user01.
bkt01-log1/user01/bkt01/2025/07/08/2025-07-08-07-40-35-
## DB64FAC840EC564B
This format is largely aligned with the standard AWS S3 date-based partitioning approach.
However, key differences include the replacement of:
- SourceAccountId → ZoneId
- SourceRegion → UserId
These substitutions map more directly to PowerScale S3 concepts, providing better
contextual alignment within the PowerScale environment.
Log record format
The log format follows the AWS S3 server access log format, ensuring familiarity and
consistency for users accustomed to S3 logging standards. For fields that are either not
applicable to specific operations or not currently supported by PowerScale S3, the log
record will display a placeholder value of '-', examples include:
- Version ID: Shown as '-' since PowerScale S3 does not currently support S3
versioning.
- Access Point ARN: Replaced with '-' as this field is specific to AWS infrastructure.
Below is an example of the access log content:

OneFS S3 supported object APIs

38 Dell PowerScale: OneFS S3 API Guide
OneFS S3 ETag
AWS S3 may use an MD5 Checksum as an ETag value for objects. This value may be
specified in the HTTP Header “Content-MD5”. In OneFS 9.0 and OneFS 9.1, OneFS uses
the MD5 value from client as an ETag directly instead of calculating it by itself. If the MD5
is not specified in client request, OneFS generates a unique string for that file as an ETag
in response. This behavior is different from AWS S3.
Most S3 applications do not send the MD5 value in their requests, thus, OneFS generates
a unique string for that file as an ETag in response. This behavior causes many issues
with applications that rely on the ETag value. Therefore, starting from OneFS 9.2, OneFS
introduces two new options to allow administrators to specify if the MD5 should be
calculated and verified.
These two options are under the S3 zone settings. You can configure them using CLI isi
s3 settings zone modify --use-md5-for-etag=true/false  --validate-content-
md5=true/false or WebUI, shown as Figure 1.
# isi s3 settings zone view

Note: Objects created with a multipart upload request do not use MD5 value as ETag.
Presigned URLs
A presigned URL gives you access to the object identified in the URL, OneFS supports
presigned URLs to allow users to access objects without needing credentials. Please refer
to AWS S3 Presigned URLs for more details.
Chunked upload
There are two types of uploading options when authenticating requests using the
Authorization header of AWS Signature Version 4:
- Transfer payload in a single chunk
- Transfer payload in multiple chunks (chunked upload)
Starting with OneFS 9.3.0, the chunked upload is introduced. With chunked upload, you
can break up your payload into chunks. These can be fixed or variable-size chunks. By
uploading data in chunks, you avoid reading the entire payload to calculate the signature.
Instead, for the first chunk, you calculate a seed signature that uses only the request
headers. The second chunk contains the signature for the first chunk, and each
subsequent chunk contains the signature for the chunk that precedes it. At the end of the
upload, you send a final chunk with 0 bytes of data that contains the signature of the last
chunk of the payload. You can refer to AWS S3 Chunked Upload for more details.
Inter-level directory
Starting from OneFS 9.3.0, the concept of "inter-level directory" is introduced. An inter-
level directory in OneFS refers to directories within an S3 bucket that contain the
.isi_s3_dir file.

OneFS S3 supported object APIs

40 Dell PowerScale: OneFS S3 API Guide
When uploading an object that requires a parent directory, such as uploading an object
with the key "a/b/c" and directories "a/" and "b/" do not exist in OneFS, OneFS will
automatically create these directories to store the file "c". Additionally, OneFS will create a
file named .isi_s3_dir in each newly created directory.
The introduction of inter-level directories changes the OneFS behavior of the delete
bucket and list objects S3 API.
Table 32. Delete bucket and list objects behavior
Before OneFS 9.3.0 OneFS 9.3.0 and above
Delete bucket Bucket can be deleted only
if the bucket path does not
contain any directories and
files.
Bucket can be deleted if
the bucket path is empty or
only contains the inter-level
directories. The empty
inter-level directories are
deleted as well.
List objects
List objects API lists empty
directories as object. For
example, “a/b/c/” is
returned as object where
“c/” is a OneFS directory.
List objects ignores empty
inter-level directories
without specify delimiter "/"
## .

Delete bucket examples
- Empty bucket path
▪ Bucket path: /ifs/data/s3-bkt, the bucket path is empty, see below:

## API.
Enhanced compatibility with directory objects
In AWS S3, the object keys "a/" and "a/b" represent distinct data entities. AWS S3 permits
users to delete the object "a/" while retaining the object "a/b".
However, within OneFS, if you explicitly upload two objects "a/" and "a/b", the object "a/"
functions as a directory in OneFS, while "a/b" is recognized as a file nested under the
directory "a/". Attempting to delete the object "a/" in OneFS fails with HTTP error 200
because the directory "a/" is not empty.
To align OneFS S3 behavior more closely with AWS S3, starting from OneFS 9.7.0, when
deleting a directory object, the directory transitions into an inter-level directory with the
creation of a .isi_s3_dir file. This transition occurs seamlessly without triggering any error
prompts for clients. Below is an example:
- Assume there is a bucket using bucket path /ifs/data/s3-bkt/
- Put object “dir01/” to OneFS cluster, OneFS will create a directory /ifs/data/s3-
bkt/dir01/
- Put object “dir01/file01” to OneFS cluster, OneFS will create a file /ifs/data/s3-
bkt/dir01/file01
- Try to delete the object “dir01/”  with S3 DeleteObject API,
▪ Before OneFS 9.3.0: delete object “dir01/”  failed using S3 DeleteObject API.
▪ OneFS 9.3.0 and above: delete object “dir01/”  successfully using S3
DeleteObject API, and OneFS creates a .isi_s3_dir file under directory
## /ifs/data/s3-bkt/dir01/.
S3A connector support
S3A is an open-source connector that allows big data applications like Apache Hadoop,
Spark, and Hive to efficiently access and interact with data stored in Amazon S3 and S3
compatible storage. It uses the s3a:// URI scheme. Starting from OneFS 9.11, S3A is
officially supported. To access OneFS data using S3A, the following configuration should
be done:
- Enable OneFS S3 service and create an S3 bucket.
- Generate S3 user ID and access key.

OneFS S3 supported object APIs

42 Dell PowerScale: OneFS S3 API Guide
- Configure your application to use OneFS S3 service, for example of Hadoop, you
can refer to Apache Hadoop Amazon Web Services support – Connecting to an
Amazon S3 Bucket through the S3A Connector.
Note: Some of S3A clients only work if OneFS uses MD5 as etag.
By default, S3A uploads files as a temporary file first, then copy it to target file name to
mimic rename. This is unnecessary because S3 provides atomicity guarantee. Consider
using the direct upload option. For example, hadoop fs has -d option and distcp has --
direct option.
S3 cluster status API
Starting from OneFS 9.11, OneFS S3 provides the ability to query cluster health and
performance status via a special S3-compatible API, making it easy to integrate system
telemetry directly into existing S3 workflows or monitoring pipelines.
By performing a GET request on a virtual bucket/object pair, authenticated S3 users can
get the following cluster status information:
- Total capacity and free space (in TB and TiB)
- Cluster health (overall state, percentage health score)
- Network status (Full, Half, Critical, Unknown)
- Read/write bandwidth (15-minute average)
How it Works
The OneFS S3 Cluster Status API provides a simple way to retrieve infrastructure insights
by targeting a specific virtual bucket and object (by default:
cluster_status/s3_cluster_status_v1). It supports only HEAD and GET operations, while
all other S3 methods (such as PUT or DELETE) will return a 405 Method Not Allowed
error. The API is enabled and configured using the isi_gconfig tool. Once activated, it
allows tools like s5cmd or custom S3 clients to access cluster status data easily,
eliminating the need for SSH access or separate monitoring APIs.

Get multipart upload (MPU) completion progress
Multipart upload (MPU)
OneFS S3 provides the option to upload large files as multiple parts, rather than as a
single request. To initiate a multipart upload, the client sends a POST request with the
`uploads` query parameter and the object key, along with any optional metadata attributes
and ACL for the file. A unique `uploadId` is generated and returned to the client, and a
directory named `.s3_parts_<uploadId>` is created in the target directory to store the
parts. Each part is uploaded with a part number and stored in this directory, with a
maximum size of 5GB and a minimum size of 5MB (except for the last part).
Fast path and slow path
As mentioned above, OneFS S3 Multipart Upload (MPU) allows clients to increase upload
throughput and reduce the cost of failed transmissions by splitting objects into equal-sized
parts. The typical MPU workflow involves uploading parts, with only failed parts being re-
uploaded. To optimize completion times, PowerScale's MPU completion process follows a
fast path if the following conditions are met:
- Parts are equal-sized (except for the final part)
- Parts are only re-uploaded in case of failure; the re-uploaded part will have the
same size as the original
- All uploaded parts are included in the final object at completion time
- Part numbers start from 1
- There are no gaps in the part number sequence
If any of these conditions are not met, the system falls back to a slow path, which may
result in longer completion time. Additionally, even if the fast path is initially followed, if
any recovered part fails validation or processing, the process will also revert to the slow
path.
As of OneFS version 9.13.0.0, the S3 API has been enhanced with the introduction of the
GetMPUCompletionProgress API. This new API enables clients to monitor the progress of
the Multipart Upload (MPU) completion process, providing greater visibility and control
over the upload process.
To support the GetMPUCompletionProgress API, the CompleteMultipartUpload API
response header has been extended to include three additional fields when MPU
completion progress is enabled:
- Completion-Id: An identifier used by the GetMPUCompletionProgress call to
retrieve the progress of the MPU completion process.
- Fast-Path: A boolean value indicating whether the MPU completion is using the
fast path optimization.

GetMPUCompletionProgress API Request Pattern
The GetMPUCompletionProgress API is invoked using the following HTTP GET request
pattern:
## • GET
http://{endpoint}/{bucket_name}/{object_key}?completionId={c
ompletion_id}&uploadId={upload_id}
For example, the client would send a GET request to:
- http://192.168.1.100:9020/mpubucket/file1?completionId=c20c8
afe-b8ce-7aa4-6e35-817b144b2568&uploadId=1_1000000018001_1
GetMPUCompletionProgress API Response
The response from the GetMPUCompletionProgress API includes the following
information:
- Fast Path : Indicates whether the MPU completion is using the fast path
optimization.
- Total Parts : The total number of parts in the multipart upload.
- Total Recovery Parts : The total number of parts that require recovery.
- Completed Parts : The number of parts that have been successfully completed.
- Recovered Parts : The number of parts that have been successfully recovered.

OneFS S3 limitations

## 47
Dell PowerScale: OneFS S3 API Guide

OneFS S3 limitations

This section addresses the limitations of the OneFS S3 implementation. It is
recommended to take these limitations into consideration when designing an application
to work with OneFS S3.
Table 36 shows the details about OneFS S3 limitations.
Table 36. OneFS S3 limitations
## Feature Limitation
Object versioning OneFS does not support Amazon S3 object
versioning. It is recommended to use
OneFS SnapshotIQ as an alternative
method.
Object key delimiter Starting from OneFS 9.3.0, OneFS supports
the following delimiter format:
- Delimiter contains only one single
slash(“/”) character by default.
- Delimiter contains only one single
slash(“/”) at the end, such as “abc/”.
Delimiter does not contain any slash(“/”),
such as “abcd”. Therefore, “/abcd” and
“ab/cd” are not valid delimiters.
Number of buckets There are 1,000 buckets per user and
40,000 per cluster.
User-defined metadata
- The key of user-defined metadata
consists of a maximum of 200 Bytes of
UTF-8 encoded, case-sensitive,
alphanumeric characters, the period (.),
and the underscore (_) characters.
- The value of user-defined metadata is
not more than 1,024 bytes.
- At most, 128 user-metadata are allowed
for an object.
- The total size of the HTTP header
(including user-defined metadata and
other headers) may not exceed 8 KB in
OneFS. The total size of user-defined
metadata is limited and varies
depending on the actual HTTP request.
Bucket traversal
An S3 user must traverse or execute
permissions on all elements of the path to
reach an object in the OneFS directory
hierarchy.
Object size An object may not exceed 16 TiB, which is
aligned with the OneFS file system.


## Overview

Appendix A: OneFS S3 extended-request parameter examples

When creating a bucket through S3, OneFS provides an optional S3 extension to specify
a OneFS directory as a bucket path. The following is an example of adding the extended
header through boto3.
import boto3
HOST=<ip/fqdn>  # Your SmartConnect name or cluster IP goes
here
USERNAME='1_local_user01_accid'  # Your access ID
USERKEY='mWQbXkadl2CR_x2_WRj4tYu_d11j'   # Your secret key
URL = 'http://{}:9020'.format(HOST)
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
session = boto3.Session()
s3client =
session.client(service_name='s3',aws_access_key_id=USERNAME,aws_se
cret_access_key=USERKEY,endpoint_url=URL,use_ssl=False,verify=Fals
e)
bucket_name='bucket01'
bucket _path = "/ifs/data/s3buckets/{}".format(bucket_name)
headers = {'x-isi-path': bucket_path}

# pass in custom headers before CreateBucket call
add_headers = (lambda **kwargs:
kwargs['params']['headers'].update(headers))
s3client.meta.events.register('before-call.s3.CreateBucket',
add_headers)

s3client.create_bucket(Bucket=bkt_name)

By default, a bucket cannot be deleted if it is not empty. With the x-isi-force-delete
extension, a bucket can be deleted from OneFS while preserving the data under the
bucket. This option is effective if it is contained in a request. A value does not have to be
assigned for this header, and an empty string is acceptable. The following is an example
of adding the extended header through boto3.
import boto3
HOST=<ip/fqdn>  # Your SmartConnect name or cluster IP goes
here
USERNAME='1_local_user01_accid'  # Your access ID
USERKEY='mWQbXkadl2CR_x2_WRj4tYu_d11j'   # Your secret key
