Executive summary

This document provides design considerations for understanding, configuring, and
troubleshooting Dell PowerScale scale-out NAS external networking. In a scale-out NAS
environment, the overall network architecture must be configured to maximize the user
experience. Many factors contribute to overall network performance. This document
examines network architecture design and best practices, including factors such as latency,
flow control, ICMP, MTU, jumbo frames, congestion, TCP/IP parameters, and IPv6.
## .
The network design considerations described in this document are based on general
network design and are provided as guidance to PowerScale administrators. All these
considerations might not apply to each workload. It is important to understand each

Network architecture design

The architecture design is the core foundation of a reliable and highly available network,
considering capacity and bandwidth. Layered on top of the foundation are the many
applications running on a campus network, with each requiring specific features and
considerations.
For the following sections, an understanding of the differences between distribution and
access switches is important. Typically, distribution switches perform L2/L3 connectivity,
while access switches are strictly L2. The following figure provides the representation for
each.

Figure 1. Distribution and access switches

Designing a network is unique to the requirements of each enterprise data center. There
is not a “one size fits all” design and not a single “good network design.” When
approaching network design, use principles as a leading factor, coupled with the
enterprise requirements. The requirements must include current and future application
consumption, providing the guiding factor in major decisions.
Network design is based on many concepts. Note the following considerations and
principles to guide the process:
- Single points of failure: Ensure that the network design has layers of redundancy.
Dependence on a single device or link relates to a loss of resources or outages.
The enterprise requirements consider risk and budget, guiding the level of
redundancy. Implement redundancy through backup paths and load sharing. If a
primary link fails, traffic uses a backup path. Load sharing creates two or more

paths to the same endpoint and shares the network load. When designing access
to PowerScale nodes, assume links and hardware will fail, and ensure that access
to the nodes will survive those failures.
- Application and protocol traffic: Understanding the application data flow from
clients to the PowerScale cluster across the network allows for resources to be
allocated accordingly while minimizing latency and hops along this flow.
- Available bandwidth: As traffic traverses the different layers of the network, the
available bandwidth should not be significantly different. Compare this available
bandwidth with the workflow requirements.
- Minimizing latency: Ensuring that latency is minimal from the client endpoints to
the PowerScale nodes maximizes performance and efficiency. Several steps can
be taken to minimize latency. Consider latency throughout network design.
- Prune VLANs: Limit VLANs to areas where they are applicable. Pruning unneeded
VLANs is also good practice. Trunking unneeded VLANs further down the network
imposes additional strain on endpoints and switches. Broadcasts are propagated
across the VLAN and affect clients.
- VLAN hopping: VLAN hopping has two methods, switch spoofing and double
tagging. Switch spoofing is when a host imitates the behavior of a trunking switch,
allowing access to other VLANs. Double tagging is a method where each packet
contains two VLAN tags—the assigned or correct VLAN tag is empty, and the
second tag is the VLAN where access is not permitted. Assigning the native VLAN
to an ID that is not in use is recommended. Otherwise, tag the native VLAN to avoid
VLAN hopping, allowing a device to access a VLAN it normally would not have
access to. Also, only allow trunk ports between trusted devices and assign access
VLANs on ports that are different from the default VLAN.

This section provides best practices for Layer 2 access network design. Although many
network architectures might meet enterprise requirements, this document takes a closer
look at what is commonly referred to as the Triangle Looped Access Topology, which is
the most widely implemented architecture in enterprise data centers.
Triangle looped
topology

Network architecture design

8 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations


## Figure 2. Triangle Looped Access Topology
The Looped Design Model extends VLANs between the aggregation switches, thus
creating the looped topology. To prevent loops, Spanning Tree is implemented using
Rapid PVST+ or MST. For each path, a redundant path also exists, which is blocked until
the primary path is not available. Access layer uplinks may be used to load balance
VLANs. A key point to consider with the Looped Access Topology is the utilization of the
inter-switch link between the distribution switches. The utilization must be monitored
closely because this link is used to reach active services.
The Looped Triangle Access Topology supports VLAN extension and L2 adjacency
across the Access layer. By using STP and dual homing, the Looped Triangle is resilient.
Stateful services are supported at the aggregation layer and quick convergence with
## 802.1W/S.
Using the Triangle Looped Topology allows for multiple access switches to interface with
the external network of the PowerScale scale-out NAS environment. Each PowerScale
node within a cluster is part of a distributed architecture, which allows each node to have
similar properties regarding data availability and management.

In the context of the IEEE 802.1AX standard, link aggregation provides methods to
combine multiple Ethernet interfaces, forming a single link layer interface, specific to a
switch or server. Therefore, link aggregation is implemented between a single switch and
a PowerScale node, not across PowerScale nodes.
Implementing link aggregation is neither mandatory nor is it necessary, rather it is based
on workload requirements. Implementing link aggregation is recommended if a
transparent failover or switch port redundancy is required.
Link aggregation assumes all links are full duplex, point to point, and at the same data
rate, providing graceful recovery from link failures. If a link fails, traffic is automatically
sent to the next available link without disruption.
Link aggregation

Network architecture design

## 9
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
It is imperative to understand that link aggregation is not a substitute for a higher
bandwidth link. Although link aggregation combines multiple interfaces, applying it to
multiply bandwidth by the number of interfaces for a single session is incorrect. Link
aggregation distributes traffic across links. However, a single session only uses a single
physical link to ensure packets are delivered in order without duplication of frames.
As part of the IEEE 802.1AX standard, the Frame Distributor does not specify a
distribution algorithm across aggregated links but enforces that frames must be sent in
order without duplication. Frame order is maintained by ensuring that all frames of a given
session are transmitted on a single link in the order that they are generated by the client.
The mandate does not allow for additions or modifications to the MAC frame, buffering, or
processing to re-order frames by the Frame Distributor or Collector.
Thus, the bandwidth for a single client is not increased, but the aggregate bandwidth of all
clients increases in an active/active configuration. The aggregate bandwidth is realized
when carrying multiple simultaneous sessions. It might not provide a linear multiple of
each link’s data rate because each individual session uses a single link.
Another factor to consider depends on the workload--certain protocols might or might not
benefit from link aggregation. Stateful protocols such as NFSv4 and SMBv2 benefit from
link aggregation as a failover mechanism. On the contrary, SMBv3 Multichannel
automatically detects multiple links, using each for maximum throughput and link
resilience.

Depending on the workload, each
protocol has varying limitations and
advantages of link aggregation.
Load balancing.

OneFS supports round robin, failover, load-balance, and LACP link aggregation methods.
In previous releases, FEC was also listed as an option. However, FEC was simply the
naming convention for load-balance. In OneFS 8.2, load-balance replaces the FEC
option.
Multi-chassis link aggregation
As discussed in the previous section, the IEEE 802.1AX standard does not define Link
Aggregation between multiple switches and a PowerScale node. However, many vendors
provide this functionality through proprietary features. Multiple switches are connected
with an Inter-Switch link or other proprietary cable and communicate by a proprietary
protocol forming a virtual switch. A virtual switch is perceived as a single switch to a
PowerScale node, with links terminating on a single switch. The ability to have link

aggregation split with multiple chassis provides network redundancy if a single chassis
were to fail.
Each vendor has a proprietary implementation of Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation, but
externally the virtual switch created is compliant with the IEEE 802.1AX standard.
Regarding bandwidth, the concepts discussed for single switch Link Aggregation still
apply to Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation. Also, because the multiple switches form a
single virtual switch, it is important to understand what happens if the switch hosting the
control plane fails. Those effects vary by the vendor’s implementation but will affect the
network redundancy gained through Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation.
Latency, bandwidth, and throughput

Maximizing overall network performance depends on several factors. However, the three
biggest factors contributing to end-to-end performance are latency, throughput, and
bandwidth. This section focuses on these factors to maximize the PowerScale user
experience.

Latency in a packet-switched network is defined as the time from when a source endpoint
sends a packet to when it is received by the destination endpoint. Round-trip latency,
sometimes referred to as round-trip delay, is the amount of time for a packet to be sent
from the source endpoint to the destination endpoint and returned from the destination to
the source endpoint.
Minimal latency in any transaction is imperative for several reasons. IP endpoints,
switches, and routers operate optimally without network delays. Minimal latency between
clients and a PowerScale node ensures performance is not affected. Latency increases
between two endpoints might lead to several issues that heavily degrade performance,
depending on the application.
To minimize latency, you must measure it accurately between the endpoints. For
assessing PowerScale nodes, latency is measured from the clients to a specified node.
The measurement could use the IP of a specific node or the SmartConnect hostname.
After applying configuration changes that affect latency, verify that the latency has indeed
decreased. When attempting to minimize latency, consider the following information:
- Hops: Minimizing hops required between endpoints decreases latency. The
implication is not to drag cables across a campus, but the goal is to confirm if any
unnecessary hops could be avoided. Minimizing hops applies at the physical level
with the number of switches between the endpoints but also applies logically to
network protocols and algorithms.
- ASICs: When thinking about network hops, consider the ASICs within a switch. If a
packet enters through one ASIC and exits through the other, latency could
increase. If possible, keep traffic as part of the same ASIC to minimize latency.
- Network congestion: NFS v3, NFSv4, and SMB employ the TCP protocol. For
reliability and throughput, TCP uses windowing to adapt to varying network
congestion. At peak traffic, congestion control is triggered, dropping packets, and
leading TCP to use smaller windows. In turn, throughput could decrease, and

## 11

overall latency might increase. Minimizing network congestion ensures it does not
affect latency. It is important to architect networks that are resilient to congestion.
- Routing: Packets that pass through a router might induce additional latency.
Depending on the router configuration, packets are checked for a match against
defined rules, sometimes requiring packet header modification.
- MTU mismatch: Depending on the MTU size configuration of each hop between
two endpoints, an MTU mismatch might exist. Therefore, packets must be split to
conform to upstream links, creating additional CPU overhead on routers and NICs,
creating higher processing times, and leading to additional latency.
- Firewalls: Firewalls provide protection by filtering through packets against set rules
for additional steps. The filtering process consumes time and could create further
latency. Processing times are heavily dependent upon the number of rules in place.
It is good measure to ensure outdated rules are removed to minimize processing
times.

Understanding the difference between throughput and bandwidth are important for
network troubleshooting. Although these terms are conflated at times, they are actually
both unique. Bandwidth is the theoretical maximum speed a specific medium can deliver if
all factors are perfect without any form of interference.
Throughput is the actual speed realized in a real-world scenario, given interference and
other environmental factors such as configuration, contention, and congestion.
The difference between these terms is important when troubleshooting. If a PowerScale
node supports 40 GbE, it does not necessarily mean the throughput is 40 Gb/s. The
throughput between a client and a PowerScale node depends on all the factors between
the two endpoints and can be measured with various tools.
During the design phase of a data center network, ensure that bandwidth is available
throughout the hierarchy, eliminating bottlenecks and ensuring consistent bandwidth. The
bandwidth from the access switches to the PowerScale nodes should be a ratio of what is
available back to the distribution and core switches. For example, if a PowerScale cluster
of 12 nodes has all 40 GbE connectivity to access switches, the link from the core to
distribution to access should be able to handle the throughput from the access switches.
Ideally, the link from the core to distribution to access should support roughly a bandwidth
of 480 Gb (12 nodes * 40 GbE).
Bandwidth delay product
Bandwidth Delay Product (BDP) is calculated to find the amount of data a network link is
capable of, in bytes, which can be transmitted on a network link at a given time. The
keyword is transmitted, meaning the data is not yet acknowledged. BDP considers the
bandwidth of the data link and the latency on that link, in terms of a round-trip delay.
The amount of data that can be transmitted across a link is vital to understanding
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) performance. Achieving maximum TCP throughput
requires that data must be sent in quantities large enough before waiting for a
confirmation message from the receiver, which acknowledges the successful receipt of
data. The successful receipt of the data is part of the TCP connection flow. The following
figure explains the steps of a TCP connection and where BDP is applicable:
Bandwidth and
throughput

Latency, bandwidth, and throughput

12 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations


Figure 3. Transmission Control Protocol message flow
In the preceding figure, four states are highlighted during a TCP connection. The following
summarizes each state:
- TCP Handshake – Establishes the TCP connection through an SYN, SYN/ACK,
## ACK
- Data transmitted to the server. BDP is the maximum amount of data that can be
sent at this step.
- Data acknowledged by Server
- TCP Connection Close Sequence – Socket closure is initiated by either side
Once the BDP rate is calculated, the TCP stack is tuned for the maximum throughput,
which is discussed in the next section. The BDP is calculated by multiplying the bandwidth
of the network link (bits/second) by the round-trip time (seconds).
For example, a link with a bandwidth of 1 gigabit per second and a 1-millisecond round-
trip time is calculated as:
Bandwidth * RTT = 1 Gigabit per second * 1 millisecond =
1,000,000,000 bits per second * 0.001 seconds = 1,000,000 bits =
## 0.125 MB
Thus, 0.125 MB may be sent per TCP message to the server.

Once the BDP is calculated and understood, these findings can be applied to modifying
the TCP stack on the PowerScale cluster. All PowerScale clusters do not require TCP
stack tuning. Only alter the TCP stack for a needed workflow improvement. Most
PowerScale environments do not need TCP tuning. Before applying any TCP changes,

ensure the network is clean and reliable by performing basic checks for excessive
retransmits, duplicate or fragmented packets, and broken pipes.
PowerScale OneFS is built on FreeBSD. A PowerScale cluster is composed of nodes with
a distributed architecture, and each node provides external network connectivity. Adapting
the TCP stack to bandwidth, latency, and MTU requires tuning to ensure the cluster
provides optimal throughput.
In the previous section, BDP was explained in depth and how it is the amount of data that
can be sent across a single TCP message flow. Although the link supports the BDP that is
calculated, the OneFS system buffer must be able to hold the full BDP. Otherwise, TCP
transmission failures might occur. If the buffer does not accept all the data of a single
BDP, the acknowledgment is not sent, creating a delay, and the workload performance is
degraded.
The OneFS network stack must be tuned to ensure on inbound, the full BDP is accepted,
and on outbound, it must be retained for a possible retransmission. Before modifying the
TCP stack, measure the current I/O performance, and then measure it again after
implementing changes. Test this tuning guidance in a lab environment before modifying a
production network.
The following spreadsheet provides the necessary TCP stack changes based on the
bandwidth, latency, and MTU. The changes must be implemented in the order shown and
all together on all nodes. Modifying only some variables could lead to unknown results.
After making changes, measure performance again.
Note: The snippet below is only for representation. It is imperative to input the calculated
bandwidth, latency, and MTU specific to each environment.

Ethernet flow control

Under certain conditions, packets sent from the source to the destination can overwhelm
the destination endpoint. The destination is not able to process all packets at the rate that
they are sent, leading to retransmits or dropped packets. Most scenarios have a fast
source endpoint and a slower destination endpoint; this could be due to processing power
or several source endpoints interacting with a single destination. Flow control is
implemented to manage the rate of data transfer between these IP endpoints, providing
an option for the destination to control the data rate, and ensuring the destination is
capable of processing all the packets from the source.
The IEEEs 802.3x standard defines an Ethernet Flow Control mechanism at the Data Link
Layer. It specifies a pause flow control mechanism through MAC Control frames in full-
duplex link segments. For flow control to be successfully implemented, it must be
configured throughout the network hops that the source and destination endpoints
communicate through. Otherwise, the pause flow control frames are not recognized and
are dropped.
By default, PowerScale OneFS listens for pause frames but does not transmit them,
meaning it is only applicable when a PowerScale node is the source. In the default
behavior, OneFS recognizes pause frames from the destination. However, pause frames
may be enabled for transmit, depending on the NIC.
Most network devices today do not send pause frames, but certain devices still send
them.

If the network or cluster performance does not seem optimal, it is easy to check for pause
frames on a PowerScale cluster.
If pause frames are reported, discuss these findings with the network engineering team
before making any changes. As mentioned, changes must be implemented across the
network, ensuring all devices recognize a pause frame. Contact the switch manufacturer’s
support teams or account representative for specific steps and caveats for implementing
flow control before proceeding.

SyncIQ considerations

PowerScale SyncIQ provides asynchronous data replication for disaster recovery and
business continuity, allowing failover and failback between clusters. It is configurable for
either complete cluster replication or only for specific directories. Within a PowerScale
cluster, all nodes can participate in replication. After an initial SyncIQ replication, only
changed data blocks are copied minimizing network bandwidth and resource utilization on
clusters.
This section provides considerations for SyncIQ pertaining to external network
connectivity. For more information about SyncIQ, see the PowerScale SyncIQ:
Architecture, Configuration, and Considerations white paper.
## Introduction

Quality of Service (QoS)

16 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations


Dedicated static SmartConnect zones are required for SyncIQ replication traffic. As with
any static SmartConnect zone, the dedicated replication zone requires one IP address for
each active logical interface—for example, in the case of two active physical interfaces,
10gige-1 and 10gige-2, requiring two IP addresses. However, if these are combined with
link aggregation, interface 10gige-agg-1 only requires one IP address. Source-restrict all
SyncIQ jobs to use the dedicated static SmartConnect zone on the source cluster and
repeat the same on the target cluster.
By restricting SyncIQ replication jobs to a dedicated static SmartConnect zone, replication
traffic may be assigned to specific nodes, reducing the impact of SyncIQ jobs on user or
client I/O. The replication traffic is directed without reconfiguring or modifying the
interfaces participating in the SmartConnect zone.
For example, consider a data ingest cluster for a sports TV network. The cluster must
ingest large amounts of data recorded in 4K video format. The data must be active
immediately, and the cluster must store the data for extended periods of time. The sports
TV network administrators want to keep data ingestion and data archiving separate, to
maximize performance. The sports TV network purchased two types of nodes: H500s for
ingesting data, and A200s for the long-term archive. Due to the extensive size of the
dataset, SyncIQ jobs replicating the data to the disaster recovery site, have a significant
amount of work to do on each pass. The front-end interfaces are saturated on the H500
nodes for either ingesting data or performing immediate data retrieval. The CPUs of those
nodes must not be affected by the SyncIQ jobs. By using a separate static SmartConnect
pool, the network administrators can force all SyncIQ traffic to leave only the A200 nodes
and provide maximum throughput on the H500 nodes.

Depending on the network topology and configuration, in certain cases PowerScale
SyncIQ data may be sent across a dedicated WAN link separated from client traffic.
Under these circumstances, the recommended option is using a different subnet on the
PowerScale cluster for replication traffic, separated from the subnet for user data access.
Quality of Service (QoS)
As more applications compete for a shared link with limited throughput, ensuring Quality
of Service (QoS) for application success is critical. Each application has varying QoS
requirements to deliver not only service availability, but also an optimal client experience.
Associating each application to an appropriate QoS marking, provides traffic policing,
allowing packets to be prioritized as required across a shared medium, all while delivering
an ideal client experience.
QoS can be implemented using different methods. However, the most common is through
a Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), which specifies a value in the packet
header that maps to a traffic effort level.
The OneFS 9.9.0.0 release introduced an option for DSCP marking to provide QoS. The
OneFS DSCP configuration is cluster-wide across all the nodes and is based on the class
of network traffic. Once configured, OneFS inserts the DSCP marking in the Traffic Class
or Type of Service fields of the header for IPv6 or IPv4 packets, respectively.

The OneFS firewall matches outgoing network traffic on the front-end ports to a QoS
class. The traffic is matched using the source ports and/or destination ports from the top
to the bottom in the table above. If no match is found, the Catch-All class is applied. QoS
is only applicable on the front-end network ports and has no impact on the back-end
networking. The firewall assigns the DSCP value based on the QoS class.
Note: To provide QoS, the OneFS firewall filters through outgoing packets and may have a
performance impact. Although the impact should be minimal, you should test in a lab environment
to confirm workloads are not impacted before configuring on a production cluster.

Software-Defined Networking
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) provides automated policy-based management of
network architecture. The management and administration are centralized by separating
the control and data planes. SDN architectures include a controller functioning as a
central point of management and automation. The controller is responsible for relaying
information downstream to firewalls, routers, switches, and access points. On the
contrary, the controller sends information upstream to applications and orchestration
frameworks, all while presenting the SDN architecture as a single device.
Datacenters that have an SDN architecture and a PowerScale cluster must have
traditional access switches connected to PowerScale nodes, presenting a traditional
network architecture to OneFS.

Figure 14. PowerScale and Software-Defined Networking
The SDN implementation of each vendor is unique and is critical to understanding the
scalability and limitations of a specific architecture. Some of the SDN implementations are
based on open standards like OpenFlow, while other vendors use a mix of proprietary and
open standards, and others use a completely proprietary implementation. Reviewing the
limits of a specific implementation is essential to understanding how to maximize
performance. If a PowerScale cluster is configured for use with SDN through a traditional
access switch, consider the following information and recommendations:
- OneFS does not support VRFs and VXLANs. An intermediary solution is required
for implementing VLAN to VXLAN mapping.
- Understand the control plane scalability of each SDN implementation and if it would
affect OneFS.
- The MTU implementation for each vendor varies. Ensure consistent MTUs across
all network hops.

PowerScale OneFS ports

## 25
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
- Each switch vendor provides a different set of SDN capabilities. Mapping
differences is key to developing a data center architecture to include a PowerScale
cluster while maximizing network performance.
- Not only is each vendor's capability unique when it comes to SDN, but the
scalability of each solution and cost varies significantly. The intersection of
scalability and cost determines the architecture limits.
- Because each SDN implementation varies, consider the impacts on the automation
and policy-driven configuration. These impacts are one of the significant
advantages of SDN. Also, consider the automation interactions with Isilon PAPI.

PowerScale OneFS uses several TCP and UDP ports, which are documented in the
## Security Configuration Guide.
SmartConnect considerations

This section provides considerations for using the PowerScale SmartConnect load-
balancing service. The general IP routing principles are the same with or without
SmartConnect.
SmartConnect acts as a DNS delegation server to return IP addresses for SmartConnect
zones, generally for load-balancing connections to the cluster. The IP traffic involved is a
four-way transaction shown in the following figure:

Figure 15. SmartConnect DNS delegation steps
In the preceding figure, the arrows indicate the following steps:
- Blue arrow (step 1): The client makes a DNS request for sc-zone.domain.com by
sending a DNS request packet to the site DNS server.
- Green arrow (step 2): The site DNS server has a delegation record for sc-
zone.domain.com and sends a DNS request to the defined nameserver address in
the delegation record, the SmartConnect service (SmartConnect Service IP
## Address).
- Orange arrow (step 3): The cluster node hosting the SmartConnect Service IP
(SSIP) for this zone receives the request, calculates the IP address to assign based
on the configured connection policy for the pool in question (such as round robin),
and sends a DNS response packet to the site DNS server.
- Red arrow (step 4): The site DNS server sends the response back to the client.
## Introduction

SmartConnect considerations

26 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations


As you define SmartConnect subnets and pools, it is important to understand the
SmartConnect hierarchy, as displayed in the following figure:

Figure 16. SmartConnect network hierarchy – OneFS releases prior to 8.2
Throughout the network design phase, for releases prior to OneFS 8.2, consider that a
single SSIP is defined per subnet. However, under each subnet, pools are defined, and
each pool has a unique SmartConnect zone name. Recognize that multiple pools lead to
multiple SmartConnect zones using a single SSIP. As shown in the preceding figure, a
DNS provider is defined per groupnet, which is a feature in OneFS 8.0 and later releases.
In releases earlier than 8.0, a DNS per groupnet was not supported.
OneFS 8.2 introduces support for multiple SSIPs per subnet, as displayed in the following
figure:

SmartConnect load balances incoming network connections across SmartConnect zones
composed of nodes, network interfaces, and pools. The load-balancing policies are
Round Robin, Connection Count, CPU Utilization, and Network Throughput. The most
common load-balancing policies are Round Robin and Connection Count, but these
policies might not apply to all workloads. It is important to understand whether the front-
end connections are being evenly distributed, either in count or by bandwidth. Front-end
connection distribution can be monitored with InsightIQ or the WebUI. Because each
workload is unique, understand how each load-balancing policy functions, and test the
policy in a lab environment before a production roll-out.
The following table lists suggested policies based on the workflow, but these are general
suggestions, and might not always be applicable.
Start with Round Robin for a new implementation or if the workload is not clearly defined.
As the workload is further defined and based on the Round Robin experience, another
policy can be tested in a lab environment.

- Metrics are gathered every 5 seconds for CPU Utilization and every 10 seconds for Connection Count and Network Throughput. In
cases where many connections are created simultaneously, these metrics might not be accurate, creating an imbalance across
nodes.
Note: In contrast to “CPU” and “Throughput” methods where it is not possible to estimate the
additional load that a new connection will create with complete accuracy, the “Connection Count”
policy is able to accurately account for new connections. Therefore, it does not need to poll to
correctly track additional connections. However, it is unaware of client disconnects that occur
between poll intervals. Depending on the number and distribution of disconnects, this may cause
a temporary connection imbalance across nodes.
As discussed previously, the preceding policies mapping to workloads are general
guidelines. Each environment is unique with distinct requirements. Confirm the best load-
balancing policy in a lab environment that closely mimics the production environment.

After a groupnet and subnet are defined in OneFS, the next step is configuring an IP
address pool and assigning interfaces to participate in this pool.
After the IP address pool is defined, under the SmartConnect Advanced section, you
can select an Allocation Method. By default, this option is unavailable and shown as
Static if a SmartConnect Advanced license is not installed. If a SmartConnect Advanced
license is installed, the default Allocation Method is still Static, but you may also select
## Dynamic.
The static allocation method assigns a single persistent IP address to each interface
selected in the pool, leaving additional IP addresses in the pool unassigned if the number
of IP addresses is greater than interfaces. The lowest IP address of the pool is assigned
to the lowest Logical Node Number (LNN) from the selected interfaces, subsequently for
the second-lowest IP address and LNN. If a node or interface becomes unavailable, this
IP address does not move to another node or interface. Also, when the node or interface
becomes unavailable, it is removed from the SmartConnect zone, and new connections
will not be assigned to the node. Once the node is available again, SmartConnect adds it
back into the zone and assigns new connections.
On the contrary, the dynamic allocation method splits all available IP addresses in the
pool across all selected interfaces. Under the dynamic allocation method, OneFS
attempts to assign the IP addresses evenly if possible. However, if the interface-to-IP-
address ratio is not an integer value, a single interface might have more IP addresses
than another.

SmartConnect considerations

## 29
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

Combined with the dynamic allocation method, dynamic failover provides high availability
by transparently migrating IP addresses to another node when an interface is not
available. If a node becomes unavailable, all the IP addresses it was hosting are
reallocated across the new set of available nodes in accordance with the configured
failover load-balancing policy. The default IP address failover policy is round robin, which
evenly distributes IP addresses from the unavailable node across available nodes.
Because the IP address remains consistent, irrespective of which node it resides on,
failover to the client is transparent, so high availability is seamless.
The other available IP address failover policies are the same as the initial client
connection balancing policies, that is, connection count, throughput, or CPU usage. In
most scenarios, round robin is not only the best option but also the most common.
However, the other failover policies are available for specific workflows. As mentioned
previously, with the initial load-balancing policy, test the IP failover policies in a lab
environment to find the best option for a specific workflow.
Dynamic failover examples
The following examples illustrate how IP addresses move during a dynamic failover.
These examples illustrate the concepts of how the IP address quantity affects user
experience during a failover; use these guidelines when determining IP address quantity.

Figure 18. Dynamic allocation: Four-node cluster with one IP address per node
In this scenario, 150 clients are actively connected to each node over NFS using a
connection policy of round robin. Most NFSv3 mounted clients perform a nslookup only
the first time that they mount, never performing another nslookup to check for an updated
IP address. If the IP address changes, the NFSv3 clients have a stale mount and retain
that IP address.
Suppose that one of the nodes fails, as shown in the following figure:
Dynamic failover

SmartConnect considerations

30 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations


Figure 19. Dynamic Allocation: Four-node cluster with one IP address per node, one node
offline
A SmartConnect zone with dynamic allocation for IP addresses immediately hot-moves
the one IP address on the failed node to one of the other three nodes in the cluster. It
sends out several gratuitous address resolution protocol (ARP) requests to the connected
switch, so that client I/O continues uninterrupted.
Although all four IP addresses are still online, two of them—and 300 clients—are now
connected to one node. In practice, SmartConnect can fail only one IP to one other place,
and one IP address and 150 clients are already connected to each of the other nodes.
The failover process means that a failed node has just doubled the load on one of the
three remaining nodes while not disrupting the other two nodes. This process results in
declining client performance, but not equally. The goal of any scale-out NAS solution must
be consistency. To double the I/O on one node and not on another is inconsistent.
Dynamic allocation with 3 IP addresses per node
Dynamic SmartConnect zones require a greater number of IP addresses than the number
of nodes at a minimum to handle failover behavior. In the following example, the formula
used to calculate the number of IP addresses required is N*(N-1), where N is the number
of nodes. The formula is used for illustration purposes only to demonstrate how IP
addresses, and in turn, clients, move from one node to another, and how this could
potentially lead to an imbalance across nodes. Every workflow and cluster are unique,
and this formula is not applicable to every scenario.
This example considers the same four-node cluster as the previous example, but now
following the rule of N*(N-1). In this case, 4*(4-1) = 12, equaling three IPs per node, as
shown in the following figure:

Figure 20. Dynamic allocation: 4 node cluster with 3 IP addresses per node

SmartConnect considerations

## 31
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
When the same failure event as the previous example occurs, the three IP addresses are
spread over all the other nodes in that SmartConnect zone. This failover results in each
remaining node having 200 clients and four IP addresses. Although performance might
degrade to a certain degree, it might not be as drastic as the failure in the first scenario,
and the experience is consistent for all users, as shown in the following figure:

Figure 21. Dynamic allocation: Four-node cluster with two IP addresses per node, one node
offline

A common concern during a PowerScale configuration is choosing between static and
dynamic allocation methods. The requirement for dynamic failover depends heavily on the
protocol in use, workflow, and overall high-availability design requirements. Stateful
versus stateless protocols, combined with the allocation method, affect the reconnection
experience. Certain workflows require only downtime, or the overarching IT requirements
dictate IP address persistence. This section provides guidance on the reconnection
behavior based on the protocol. The reconnection sequence takes place during a
hardware fault, network fault, OneFS Non-Disruptive upgrade, or other scenarios with
downtime.
Client access protocols are either stateful or stateless. Stateful protocols are defined by
the client/server relationship having a session state for each open file. Session state
information for each file is not shared among PowerScale nodes.
For stateful protocols, failing over IP addresses to other nodes is dependent on the
current state of the client’s I/O status and the specific application workflow. Stateless
protocols are generally accepting of failover without session state information being
maintained, except for file level write locks. However, this is dependent on the current I/O
status and the specific application workflow. As a best practice, test the specific
application workflow in a lab environment to find the best option.
Note: For static zones, ensure SmartConnect is configured with a time-to-live of zero. For dynamic
zones, a time-to-live of zero is less critical since the IP address will always be available. However,
a larger the time-to-live value creates a greater impact on load balancing, resulting in a more
unbalanced load across nodes. For more information, see DNS and time-to-live.
## Server Message Block
The IP allocation method for Server Message Block (SMB) is based on the workflow
requirements. In certain workflows, SMB is preferred with dynamic allocation of IP
addresses, because IP address consistency is required. Aside from a workflow
requirement, it could also be an IT administrative dependence. It is also essential to note
that SMB3 Continuously Available (CA) only functions with static IPs.
Protocols and
SmartConnect
allocation
methods

SmartConnect considerations

32 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

SMB works well with dynamic allocation of IP addresses, but it is essential to understand
the protocol limitations. SMB preserves complex state information per session on the
server side. During a dynamic failover to a new node, the existing SMB connection ends
with the existing node, and a new SMB connection is established to the new node.
Depending on the client’s current I/O status, the SMB connection for the client is reset
momentarily to update the new node with the correct state information.
In this event, consider how a brief state reset impacts the workflow. For example, if the
SMB workflow is primarily reads or is heavier on the read side, the impact of a dynamic
failover described above will not be noticed because the client can quickly re-open the file
and seamlessly continue reading. For write-intensive applications, the interrupt must be
handled within the application time-out setting. A SMB protocol reset to a new connection
may be several seconds, but if the application time-out tolerance is set to one second, an
event will occur. Even if a time-out event does occur for an application, it may redrive the
write operation, and the SMB reset will still appear seamless to the application.
The OneFS SMB drain support further improves its non-disruptive upgrade capabilities by
allowing the safe disconnection of SMB clients during the upgrade process. Microsoft
Windows Continuous Availability (CA) offers this feature natively. However, it may not
always be a viable option because of the requirements for client SMB3 support. The
OneFS SMB drain feature ensures that, in non-CA scenarios, an SMB client can flush its
cache before being disconnected and with SmartConnect enables the safe migration of
SMB clients to non-rebooting cluster nodes. Once the drain service is enabled, OneFS
drains SMB connections through the following sequence:
- Locks and leases held by current SMB clients are broken. However, if the break
requires an ack from the client, OneFS waits for the client ack.
- New SMB lock and lease requests are denied.
- The client is disconnected once all locks are broken.
- The client detects the TCP reset from the disconnection and attempts to reconnect.
- SmartConnect redirects the connection to a node which is not draining, where the
client can reconnect and continue working.
Note: Clients running Microsoft Windows 10 or later complete the sequence in less than two
seconds. Clients with DNS caches, such as macOS clients, may attempt to reconnect to the
draining node.
Before a major implementation, test the workflow in a lab environment to understand the
limitations, the best practices for a specific workflow, and the application timeout setting.
OneFS 9.7.0.0 introduces SMB3 multi-channel Flexnet Awareness with a new
SmartConnect IP address library, lwsmartconnect. The new library is now Network Pool
aware with an affinity to the clients associated with the current Network Pool, in other
words, it maps the current IP address to available IPs on the node. It also removes back-
end IPs and down interfaces from the library.
## NFS
The NFSv2 and NFSv3 protocols are stateless, and in almost all cases, perform best with
dynamic allocation of IP addresses. The client does not rely on writes unless commits

SmartConnect considerations

## 33
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
have been acknowledged by the server, enabling NFS to failover dynamically from one
node to another.
The NFSv4 protocol introduces stateful client connections. OneFS retains open and lock
session-state information in a cluster-coherent way for NFSv4. For dynamic connections,
the client reconnects upon failing over to a node, but the client state is recreated. The
client reclaims all opens and locks it had prior  to failing over.
For static connections, no open or lock session-state information is stored in OneFS for
failover. The client will use pure local advisory locking, which can be beneficial for unusual
workflows, or management connections.
As a best practice, test the workflow in a lab environment to understand limitations and
the best practices  for a specific workflow.
## HDFS
The requirements for HDFS pools have been updated with the introduction of new OneFS
features and as HDFS environments have evolved. During the design phases of HDFS
pools, several factors must be considered. The use of static versus dynamic pools are
affected by:
- Use of OneFS racks if needed
- Node Pools: Is the cluster a single heterogeneous node type or do different node
pools exist
- Availability of IP addresses
These factors, coupled with the workflow requirements, determine the pool
implementation. See the HDFS Pool Usage and Assignments section in the Dell Isilon
Best Practices Guide for Hadoop Data Storage for additional details and considerations
with HDFS pool implementations.
## S3
OneFS 9.0 introduces support for Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3) protocol. The
S3 protocol is stateless. For most workflows, S3 performs optimally with dynamic
allocation of IP addresses, ensuring seamless client failover to an available node in an
event where the associated node becomes unavailable.
Suggested zones by protocol
The following table lists the suggested IP allocation strategies for SmartConnect
Advanced by the protocol. As noted, these are suggested, and the actual zone type

This section provides guidance for determining the number of IP addresses required for a
new cluster implementation. The following guidance does not apply to all clusters and is
provided as a reference for the process and considerations during a new cluster
implementation.
During the process of implementing a new cluster and building the network topology,
consider the following information and recommendations:
- Calculate the number of IP addresses that are needed based on future cluster size,
not the initial cluster size.
- Do not share a subnet with other application servers. If more IP addresses are
required, and the range is full, readdressing an entire cluster and then moving it into
a new VLAN is disruptive. These complications are prevented with proper planning.
- Static IP pools require one IP address for each logical interface that will be in the
pool. Each node provides two interfaces for external networking. If Link Aggregation
is not configured, this would require 2*N IP addresses for a static pool.
- For PowerScale clusters running a release before OneFS 8.2, use one IP address
for each SmartConnect Service IP (SSIP).
- For optimal load-balancing, during a node failure, IP pools with the dynamic
allocation method require the number of IP addresses at a minimum of the node
count and a maximum of the client count. For example, a 12-node SmartConnect
zone and 50 clients would have a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 50 IP
addresses. In many larger configurations, defining an IP address per client is not
feasible, and in those cases, the optimal number of IP addresses is workflow-
dependent and based on lab testing. In the previous examples, N*(N-1) is used to
calculate the number of IP addresses, where N is the number of nodes that will
participate in the pool. For larger clusters, this formula might not be feasible due to
the sheer number of IP addresses. Determining the number of IP addresses within
a dynamic allocation pool varies depending on the workflow, node count, and the
estimated number of clients that would be in a failover event.

quantification

SmartConnect considerations

## 35
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
- If more than a single access zone is configured with IP pools using the dynamic
allocation method, examine if all the pools are required. Reducing the number of IP
pools will also reduce the number of IP addresses required.
- If a cluster has multiple access zones or IP pools, a lower number of IP addresses
might be required. If so, consider reducing the total number of IP addresses.
Generally, as more access zones and IP address pools are configured, fewer IP
addresses are required.
In previous OneFS releases, a greater IP address quantity was recommended,
considering the typical cluster size and the workload a single node could handle during a
failover. As nodes become unavailable, all the traffic hosted on that node is moved to
another node with typically the same resources, which could lead to a degraded end-user
experience. Because PowerScale nodes are now in the 7th generation, this is no longer a
concern. Each node does have limitations, which must be considered when determining
the number of IP addresses and failover events creating additional overhead. Also, as
OneFS releases have progressed, so has the typical cluster size, making it difficult to
maintain the N*(N-1) formula with larger clusters.
From a load-balancing perspective, for dynamic pools, it is ideal for all the interfaces to
have the same number of IP addresses whenever possible. In addition to keeping in mind
the preceding points, consider the workflow and failover requirements set by IT
administrators.

corresponding to the SmartConnect Service IP (SSIP) address, serving as the glue record
in the DNS delegation tying the NS and the IP address. The DNS delegation to
SmartConnect consists of two DNS records, as listed in the following table:
SmartConnect
service name

## NS
Domain cluster.company.com SmartConnect Zone Name on the network

## A/AAAA
Domain ns.cluster.company.com SmartConnect Service Name on the

Description This entry informs the DNS server the nameserver for the PowerScale
cluster can be contacted at the 1.2.3.4 IP address specified as the
A/AAAA Value.

Note: If a value is not provided for this field, SmartConnect reuses the domain name from the nameserver and
Start of Authority queries as the nameserver hostname. If the sc-service-name on the cluster is different than the
record in the DNS Delegation, DNS resolution failures can occur; thus, ensure that these records are synchronized.

OneFS SmartConnect provides an option to administratively remove a node from a
SmartConnect zone during a planned outage. Planned outages could be hardware
replacement or maintenance activity.
Once a node is suspended, SmartConnect prevents new client connections to the node. If
the node is configured for dynamic allocation of IP addresses, IP addresses are not
assigned to this node in a suspended state. Suspending a node ensures that client
access remains consistent. After the node is suspended, client connections can be
monitored and allowed to gradually drop-off before a reboot or power down.
A node is suspended from the OneFS CLI or web interface. From the OneFS CLI, the
command is:
isi network pools --sc-suspend-node <groupnet.subnet.pool> <node ID>
Alternatively, from the web interface, click Suspend Nodes under Pool, as shown in the
following figure:
SmartConnect

SmartConnect considerations

## 37
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

Figure 23. SmartConnect node suspension
After a node is suspended, new connections are not created. Prior to rebooting or shutting
the node down, confirm all client connections have dropped by monitoring the web
interface under the Client Connections tab on the Cluster Overview page. Also, clients
might have to be manually booted from the node if they have static SMB connections with
applications that maintain connections.

Usually, we recommend that PowerScale SmartConnect Service IP addresses and
SmartConnect zone names do not have reverse DNS entries, also known as pointer
(PTR) records.
In certain environments where PTR records are required, many PTR entries might be
created because PowerScale SmartConnect pools could have hundreds of IP addresses.
In scenarios where PTR records are required, each time an additional IP address is
added to a SmartConnect pool, DNS changes are necessary to keep the environment
consistent.
Creating reverse DNS entries for the SmartConnect Service IP’s Host [address, or A]
record is acceptable if the SmartConnect Service IP is referenced only with an A record in
one DNS domain.

This section describes DNS delegation best practices for PowerScale clusters.
Delegate to address (A) records, not to IP addresses
The SmartConnect service IP address on a PowerScale cluster, in most cases, should be
registered in DNS as an address (A) record, also referred to as a host entry. For example,
the following SSIP (A) record would designate the SSIP record with a corresponding IP
address:
cls01-ssip.foobar.com. IN A 192.168.255.10
In this case, the (A) record maps the URL, cls01-ssip.foobar.com, to a corresponding IP
address of 192.168.255.10. Delegating a SmartConnect zone to an (A) record simplifies
failover and failback in business continuity, maintenance, and disaster recovery scenarios.

and Reverse

best practices

SmartConnect considerations

38 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

In such cases, the change requirement remains minimal because only a single DNS
record, the (A) record, would require an update.
All other SmartConnect zone delegations that are configured against the SSIP can be left
alone as per the example:
cls01-smb.foobar.com. IN NS cls01-ssip.foobar.com
cls01-nfs.foobar.com. IN NS cls01-ssip.foobar.com
cls01-hdfs.foobar.com. IN NS cls01-ssip.foobar.com
SmartConnect zone aliases as opposed to CNAMEs
A Canonical Name (CNAME) record is a DNS resource mapping one domain to another
domain. CNAMEs are not recommended with OneFS because it is not possible to
discover which CNAME points to a given SmartConnect zone name.
During a disaster recovery scenario, CNAMEs complicate and extend the failover process
because many CNAMEs must be updated. Further, Active Directory Kerberos does not
function with CNAMEs. Zone aliases are the recommended alternative.
OneFS provides an option for creating SmartConnect zone aliases. As a best practice, a
SmartConnect zone alias should be created in place of CNAMEs. To create a
SmartConnect zone alias, use the following command:
isi networks modify pool <subnet:pool> --add-zone-aliases=<zone
alias name>
Once the SmartConnect zone alias is provisioned, a matching delegation record must be
created in the site DNS, pointing to a SmartConnect Service IP (SSIP).
One name server record for each SmartConnect zone name or alias
One delegation for each SmartConnect zone name or each SmartConnect zone alias on a
cluster is recommended. This method permits the failover of only a portion of the cluster's
workflow—one SmartConnect zone—without affecting any other zones.
For example, an administrator might have the following delegations in place:
cls01-smb.foobar.com. IN NS cls01-ssip.foobar.com
cls01-nfs.foobar.com. IN NS cls01-ssip.foobar.com
cls01-hdfs.foobar.com. IN NS cls01-ssip.foobar.com
With this approach, the administrator has the flexibility of failing over or moving one or
multiple delegations. Consider the following example:
cls01-smb.foobar.com. IN NS cls01-ssip.foobar.com
cls01-nfs.foobar.com. IN NS cls01-ssip.foobar.com
cls01-hdfs.foobar.com. IN NS cls99-ssip.foobar.com
We recommend that you do not create a single delegation for each cluster and then
create the SmartConnect zones as sub-records of that delegation. Consider the following
example:
smb.cls01.foobar.com
nfs.cls01.foobar.com
hdfs.cls01.foobar.com

SmartConnect considerations

## 39
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
This approach enables PowerScale administrators to change, create, or modify their
SmartConnect zones and zone names as needed without involving a DNS team.
However, the disadvantage of this approach is that it causes failover operations to involve
the entire cluster and affects the entire workflow, not just the affected SmartConnect zone,
## *.cls01.foobar.com.
Multiple DNS resolvers in a groupnet
Complex data center integrations and authentication realms might require multiple DNS
resolvers within a logical group. If possible, separate these into multiple groupnets to
create a hierarchy aligning with the site environment.
Depending on the existing hierarchy, separating DNS instances in multiple groupnets
might not be an option, requiring multiple resolvers and name servers to reside in a single
groupnet. For these implementations, using DNS hosts that are capable of DNS
forwarding to forward to the corresponding DNS resolvers is recommended.
OneFS allows up to three DNS instances in a single groupnet. Proceed with caution when
adding more than a single DNS instance to a groupnet. Determining how clients are
routed to a specific DNS instance affects the client's performance and overall session
latency.
The multiple DNSs in a single groupnet are managed in OneFS through the isi
network groupnets [create or modify] command and the following options:
- --dns-options: The dns-options configuration specifies how OneFS selects
between the multiple DNS instances. In the current release, the only option is to
rotate between the instances, providing a DNS selection process of round robin.
- --dns-search: The dns-search configuration specifies up to three DNS suffixes in
a single groupnet. OneFS searches these DNS suffixes to resolve queries.
- --dns-servers: The dns-servers configuration specifies up to three IP addresses
for multiple DNS instances in a single groupnet.
For round robin options of the DNS instances or searching through more than a single
DNS suffix, it is crucial to consider the varying impacts on client experience. If the DNS for
a specific session is not consistent, the overall session latency might increase, depending
on the assigned DNS. If the latency is inconsistent, workflow success is difficult to predict,
resulting in users reporting random experiences. If a groupnet contains two DNS
instances, this results in a low chance of having the appropriate DNS assigned to a
session. If three DNS instances are specified for a groupnet, the resolution success rate
drops further.

This section provides a starting point for planning SmartConnect DNS, subnet, and
SmartConnect pool layouts that meet the needs of most new cluster implementations with
a SmartConnect Advanced License.
Note: SmartConnect Service IP Addresses (SSIPs) are only supported for use by a DNS server.
Although SSIPs may be used in other configurations, the design intent was for a DNS server.
Thus, other implementations with SSIPs are not supported.

and pool design

SmartConnect considerations

40 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

SmartConnect zone naming
For clarity and simple recognition, name SmartConnect zones according to relevant
details. For example, use some or all of the following variables when composing names:
- Cluster Name: Active Directory (AD) uses the cluster name as the AD machine
account name. For example, when a cluster named isi01 joins Active Directory,
isi01 is the cluster’s machine account name. Using the cluster/machine account
name in all DNS entries simplifies cluster administration and troubleshooting.
- IP Allocation Strategy: Each SmartConnect zone has an IP allocation strategy set
to static or dynamic. The allocation strategy is allocated in the zone name, for
example, by using d for dynamic and s for static.
- SmartConnect Pool ID: Each SmartConnect pool has a unique name or number
that identifies it. By default, the first pool called on a cluster is pool0, the second is
pool1, and so on. Use these identifiers as part of the zone name.
- SSIP: Use the SSIP in the zone name to indicate a SmartConnect Service IP zone.
These variables together form a SmartConnect zone name. For example: isi01-
s0.domain.com
The name includes the cluster name (isi01), the allocation strategy of the zone (s for
static), and the number of the pool (pool0).
For example, a cluster with three pools:
- pool0: Static for client I/O for stateful protocols
- pool1: Dynamic for client I/O for stateless protocols
- pool2: Static for Backup and Replication
Based on the SmartConnect zone, pool, and the cluster information, here is a sample
DNS layout for the cluster named isi01:
- isi01-ssip.domain.com in [A] to 10.x.y.z
- isi01-s0.domain.com in [NS] to isi01-ssip.domain.com
- isi01-d1.domain.com in [NS] to isi01-ssip.domain.com
- isi01-s2.domain.com in [NS] to isi01-ssip.domain.com
SmartConnect with multiple node pools or types
From a client or application perspective, the goals for all scale-out NAS deployments are
consistency and availability. Consistency, in this context, implies that every time a client
connects, whether that client is an application server or a user opening their home
directory, the same level of performance is provided. Dell Technologies offers several
different PowerScale node types with varied performance profiles.
Many factors determine performance in network-attached storage. In a PowerScale
cluster, key components are the front-end performance, which consists of the network
card, CPU, and memory in the node that is serving the relevant data protocol, and the
back-end performance, which, in this case, is the disk tier or pool where the data resides.
In the context of SmartConnect configuration, creating a connection pool that spans
different node performance levels is not recommended. For example, a pool with Isilon

SmartConnect considerations

## 41
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
F800 nodes and A200 nodes would provide significantly varying protocol performance. It
is imperative to understand how the nodes within a connection pool affect client
experience.

SmartConnect is, effectively, a limited implementation of a custom DNS server: It answers
only for the SmartConnect zone names or aliases configured on it. To use SmartConnect
in an isolated network environment where no DNS infrastructure is available (such as a
DMZ), configure the client systems using the SmartConnect service IP address as the
primary DNS server. Configuring the client systems this way ensures that:
- Requests to connect to PowerScale clusters with SmartConnect zone names will
succeed.
- The isolated network benefits from SmartConnect features, such as load-balancing
and rerouting traffic to prevent unavailable nodes, will work as expected in a typical,
non-isolated deployment.
It is essential to recognize that PowerScale OneFS is not a full DNS server. Hence, it will
only answer for SmartConnect zones.
Use SmartConnect zones and aliases in place of name server zones. As an example, do
not create name server zones on a bind host. Alternatively, create SmartConnect zones
and aliases.
The following commands show how to simulate and test a configuration that uses the
SmartConnect service IP address as the primary DNS server:
## C:\>nslookup
## Default Server: 10.123.17.60
## Address: 10.123.17.60

> isi01-s0.domain.com
## Server: [10.123.17.60]
## Address: 10.123.17.60

Name: isi01-s0.domain.com
## Address: 10.123.17.64

> isi01-s0.domain.com
## Server: [10.123.17.60]
## Address: 10.123.17.60

Name: isi01-s0.domain.com
## Address: 10.123.17.63

The OneFS SmartConnect DNS server is designed to respond to delegated queries from
a site DNS server for SmartConnect zones defined on the cluster. For load-balancing to
be effective, it is critically important that the site DNS servers do not cache the results.
On the cluster side, the SmartConnect time-to-live (TTL) is configurable. The default is
zero and should not be changed for normal use cases. To configure the TTL for a
SmartConnect pool, use the following command:
SmartConnect in
isolated network
environments
DNS and time-to-
live

SmartConnect considerations

42 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

isi network pools modify <pool id> --sc-ttl=0
For load-balancing to operate optimally, it is also important that the site DNS honors the
TTL returned by the OneFS SmartConnect DNS server. If the site DNS “clamps the TTL,”
it is possible for the site DNS server to erroneously return the same cached value if
multiple client requests are received within the same “clamp window.”
Microsoft Windows DNS
Windows Server DNS 2003, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2019, clamp the minimum TTL to one
second. If many client requests are expected within a one-second timeframe, consider a
different DNS server.
## BIND DNS
Newer versions of BIND have introduced features that affect the SmartConnect ability to
load balance. Depending on the BIND DNS version, consider the following information:
- BIND 9.12 introduced serve-stale functionality, which allows DNS resource records
with an expired TTL to be returned if the DNS server is failing to resolve. Under
normal operation, this feature does not cache records. However, during a
SmartConnect error, if DNS records are still in the cache, this might affect load
balancing.
- BIND 9.10.3/9.11 introduced new options to prevent DDOS attacks. The options
include max-clients-per-query and clients-per-query, which bundle
identical queries from clients and only send a single query to a recursive name
server. The clients-per-query option is the baseline for when to start bundling,
and max-clients-per-query is the cap on how many clients to bundle. For
more details on these options, see https://www.isc.org/blogs/tldr-resolver-ddos-
mitigation/.
- BIND 9.11 added options for fetches-per-server and fetches-per-zone.
Fetches-absdsper-server is a self-tuning option that limits the n
- Number of outgoing requests to individual name servers. Fetches- per-zone
limits the number of outstanding requests per zone. For more details on BIND 9.11,
see https://bind.isc.org/doc/arm/9.11/Bv9ARM.html.
Note: In an event where these limits are engaged, multiple clients receive the same IP address,
negating the SmartConnect ability to load balance connections. As a best practice, test these limits
in a lab environment and understand how each of these features affects a specific workflow.

After DNS records are updated or DNS issues are corrected, it is essential to ensure
OneFS and the site DNS server have the updated DNS records. As a best practice, run a
DNS flush on OneFS and the DNS server.
The OneFS command isi network dnscache flush flushes the DNS cache on
OneFS. Follow this command by flushing the cache on the site DNS server.

SmartConnect considerations

## 43
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

The SmartConnect Service IP (SSIP) service is updated for OneFS 8.2; this section is
specific to releases prior to OneFS 8.2. For more information about the SSIP in OneFS
8.2, see SmartConnect Multi-SSIP.
The PowerScale clustered compute and storage platform has no single point of failure.
However, the SmartConnect DNS service must be active on only one node at any time,
per subnet. The SmartConnect Service IP resides on the node with the lowest node ID
that has an interface in the given subnet, not necessarily on the node with the lowest
Logical Node Number (LNN) in the cluster.
To illustrate how this works, suppose that an existing four-node cluster is refreshed with
four new nodes. Assume that the cluster has only one configured subnet, all the nodes
are on the network, and that there are sufficient IP addresses to handle the refresh. The
first step in the cluster refresh is to add the new nodes with the existing nodes, temporarily
creating an eight-node cluster. Next, the original four nodes are SmartFailed. The cluster
is then composed of the four new nodes with the original dataset.
As the administrators perform the refresh, they check the current configuration using the
isi config command, with the status advanced command, as shown in the
following example:
isi config
>status advanced
The SmartConnect service continues to run throughout the process as the existing nodes
are refreshed. The following example illustrates where the SmartConnect service runs at
each step in the refresh process.
Once the four new nodes are added to the cluster, based on the existing naming
convention, they are automatically named clustername-5, clustername-6, clustername-7,
and clustername-8. The following table shows the Node IDs and LNNs:
Table 6. 8-node cluster configuration, before SmartFail

NodeID 1 is mapping to LNN 1.

Next, the original nodes are removed using SmartFail. The updated Node IDs and LNNs
are displayed in the following table:
Table 7. 4-node cluster configuration, after SmartFail
## Logical Node

NodeID Node name

3 7 clustername-7 New
4 8 clustername-8 New

Note: The SmartConnect service always runs on the node with the lowest node ID; here,
NodeID 5 is mapping to LNN 1.
Keeping the naming convention consistent, the administrators rename the new nodes,
formerly clustername- 5, clustername-6, clustername-7, and clustername-8, to
clustername-1, clustername-2, clustername-3, and clustername-4, respectively. The
updated Node IDs and LNNs remain the same, but map to a different Node Name, as
displayed in the following table:
Table 8. 4-node cluster configuration—after rename
## Logical Node
Number (LNN)
NodeID Node name
New or original
node
1 5 clustername-1 New
2 6 clustername-2 New
3 7 clustername-3 New
4 8 clustername-4 New

Note: The SmartConnect service always runs on the node with the lowest node ID; here,
NodeID 5 is mapping to LNN 1.
If LNN 1 is offline for maintenance, the SmartConnect service migrates to LNN 2, because
LNN 2 has the next lowest NodeID number, 6.

PowerScale OneFS 8.2 introduces support for more than one SSIP per subnet. In
previous releases, only a single SSIP per subnet was supported and resided on the
lowest available NodeID, as explained in Where the SmartConnect Service IP runs (pre
OneFS 8.2).
The dependence on a single SSIP caused problems during node maintenance, reboots,
or interface flaps. The complications are further magnified, considering the lowest
available NodeID is usually the node that is rebooted or is scheduled for maintenance
first.
SmartConnect
Multi-SSIP

SmartConnect considerations

## 45
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
The addition of more than a single SSIP provides fault tolerance and a failover
mechanism, ensuring the SmartConnect service continues to load balance clients
according to the selected policy. In previous releases of OneFS, once the node hosting
the SSIP was out of service, or if the interface was flapping, client connections would fail
momentarily as the SSIP migrated to a different node.
The number of SSIPs available per subnet depends on the SmartConnect license.
SmartConnect Basic allows two SSIPs per subnet while SmartConnect Advanced allows
six SSIPs per subnet, as displayed in the following table:
Table 9. SmartConnect SSIPs by license
SmartConnect license Basic Advanced
SSIPs per subnet 2 6

SmartConnect Multi-SSIP is not an additional layer of load balancing for client
connections. Additional SSIPs provide redundancy and reduce failure points in the client
connection sequence. Reverting to the original figure explaining the SmartConnect
connection sequence, additional connections are added at step 2, as illustrated in the
following figure:

Figure 24. SmartConnect Multi-SSIP sequence
At step 2, the site DNS server sends a DNS request to the SSIP and awaits a response in
step 3 for a node’s IP address based on the client connection policy. If for any reason, the
response in step 3 is not received within the timeout window, the connection times out.
The DNS server tries the 2nd SSIP and awaits a response in step 3. After another timeout
window, the DNS server continues cycling through subsequent SSIPs, up to the sixth
SSIP with SmartConnect Advanced, if a response is not received after a request is sent to
each SSIP.
Although the additional SSIPs are in place for failover, the SSIPs configured are active
and respond to DNS server requests. The Multi-SSIP configuration is active/passive,
where each node hosting an SSIP is independent and ready to respond to DNS server
requests, irrespective of the previous SSIP failing. Therefore, SmartConnect continues to
function correctly if the DNS server contacted the other SSIPs, providing SSIP fault
tolerance. However, as each node hosts an SSIP independent of the other SSIP hosting
nodes, it is unaware of the status of the load-balancing policy and starts the load-
balancing policy back to the first option. For example, if the SmartConnect load-balancing
policy is round robin for a 50-node subnet, assume that the first SSIP has distributed IP
addresses for the first ten nodes. If the second SSIP is contacted by the DNS server, it
starts distributing node IP addresses at the first option again, in this case, node one,

SmartConnect considerations

46 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

rather than node eleven. The node hosting the SSIP is unaware of the node IP address
distributed by the previous SSIP.
Note: As a best practice, do not configure the site DNS server to load balance the SSIPs. Each
additional SSIP is only a failover mechanism, providing fault tolerance and SSIP failover. Allow
OneFS to perform load balancing through the selected SmartConnect policy, ensuring effective
load balancing.
Configuring OneFS for SmartConnect Multi-SSIP
Multi-SSIP is configured from the user interface or the CLI, by specifying a range of IP
addresses. The range of IP addresses is applied to between two and six SSIPs per
subnet, depending on the SmartConnect license.
To configure Multi-SSIP from the user interface, click Cluster Management > Network
Configuration. Next, either select an existing subnet and click Edit, or if under a
groupnet, click More > Add subnet and scroll to the SmartConnect service IPs section,
as displayed in the following figure:

Figure 25. SmartConnect Multi-SSIP user interface configuration
To configure Multi-SSIP from the CLI, use the --sc-service-addrs option with an IP
address range, as displayed in the following command:
isi network subnets modify subnet0 --sc-service- addrs=192.168.25.10-192.168.25.11
Also, the IP address range may be cleared, or additional ranges may be added, using the
following commands:


Configuring a DNS server for SmartConnect Multi-SSIP
Multi-SSIP is a feature for SSIP failover, providing SSIP fault tolerance. Configure DNS
servers for SSIP failover, ensuring the next SSIP is only contacted if the first SSIP
connection times out. If the SSIPs are not configured in a failover sequence, the SSIP
load-balancing policy resets each time a new SSIP is contacted. The SSIPs do not track
the current distribution status of the other SSIPs because they function independently,
negating the function of the selected load-balancing policy.

SmartConnect considerations

## 47
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
Configuring IP addresses as failover-only addresses is not supported on all DNS servers.
To support Multi-SSIP as a failover only option, a DNS server with support for failover
addresses is recommended. If a DNS server does not support failover addresses, Multi-
SSIP still provides advantages over a single SSIP. However, increasing the number of
SSIPs might affect the ability of SmartConnect to load balance.
Note: If the DNS server does not support failover addresses, test Multi-SSIP in a lab environment
mimicking the production environment to confirm the impact on SmartConnect load balancing for a
specific workflow. Only after confirming workflow impacts in a lab environment should a production
cluster be updated.
DNS servers supporting failover IP addresses
If the site DNS server supports failover IP addresses, proceed with the configuration in
this section.
As explained earlier in DNS delegation best practices, the first SSIP should be created in
DNS as an address (A) record, also referred to as a host entry. The additional SSIPs
should be configured as DNS A record failover IP addresses. The first IP address should
point to the first SSIP, followed by each configured SSIP IP addresses for failover. The
additional SSIPs provide redundancy in an active/passive pattern.
DNS servers without failover IP address support
If the site DNS server does not support failover IP addresses, proceed with the
configuration in this section.
Note: Prior to configuring a DNS server that does not support failover IP addresses, consider the
load-balancing status in SmartConnect is independently managed by each SSIP, as explained in
SmartConnect Multi-SSIP. The total impact on load-balancing behavior depends on whether the
site DNS server has recursion enabled, how many SSIPs are configured, the load-balancing
policy, and the workflow. To confirm the impacts in a specific environment test in a lab
environment mimicking the production environment, prior to updating a production cluster.
To configure a DNS server for Multi-SSIP that does not support failover IP addresses,
create an NS record, and matching A/AAAA record for each SSIP. Most DNS servers us a
Round Trip Time (RTT) to decide which nameserver to use. As an example, for OneFS
and a BIND DNS server, consider the following configuration:
OneFS configuration:
isi network subnets modify groupnet0.subnet0 --sc-service-
name=cluster- ns1.company.com --sc-service-addrs=1.2.3.4-1.2.3.6
isi network pools modify groupnet0.subnet0.pool0 --sc-connect-
policy round_robin
--sc-dns-zone cluster.company.com

BIND configuration:
cluster-ns1 IN A 1.2.3.4
cluster-ns2 IN A 1.2.3.5
cluster-ns3 IN A 1.2.3.6

$ORIGIN cluster.company.com.
@ IN NS cluster-ns1.company.com.

SmartConnect considerations

48 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

@ IN NS cluster-ns2.company.com.
@ IN NS cluster-ns3.company.com.
This configuration may be adapted to Windows DNS servers or other DNS servers. The
issue with Windows DNS server is the forced 1 second TTL, which affects single SSIP
configurations also, as noted in Other SmartConnect considerations.
Also, in an environment where the site DNS server does not support failover IP
addresses, consider the following information and recommendations:
- If the site DNS server has recursion enabled, consider that the nameservers might
be contacted in a round robin fashion. To confirm this behavior, check for a
frequently changing nameserver through logging in OneFS. If the SmartConnect
zone is configured for round robin, try repeatedly querying the zone. If the DNS
server returns an IP the same number of times as SSIPs configured, it is contacting
nameservers in a round robin configuration.
- If a site DNS server is not sticky in terms of how it chooses name servers, load
balancing will decrease as the number of SSIPs in a subnet increase. For example,
consider the difference between the site DNS server returning the same IP two
times in a row when two SSIPs are configured, and the site DNS server returning
the same IP six times in a row when six SSIPs are configured.
- A load balancing problem might be exacerbated in environments with multiple
SSIPs and a site DNS server that is not preferential to a certain SSIP, if the
SmartConnect load balancing policy is not round robin. This situation could result in
more clients than expected landing on the lightest weighted node.
- If the workload consists of high throughput, usage, or demanding clients, using
Multi-SSIP makes the preceding considerations significantly more noticeable. On
the contrary, if the workload consists of many smaller client connections, the impact
of Multi-SSIP on load-balancing might go unnoticed especially with round robin
policies given that SmartConnect eventually distributes each node’s IP address
almost an equal number of times.
SSIP node assignment
Within a subnet, up to six SSIPs are available, depending on the SmartConnect license.
Prior to OneFS 8.2, the single SSIP was assigned to the lowest Node ID in the specified
subnet. Hosting the SSIP on the lowest Node ID created issues because often the lowest
Node ID is providing other services and could be the first to reboot in a rolling upgrade.
Multi-SSIP introduces an enhancement to assigning SSIPs. Attaching an SSIP to a node
is no longer dependent on the Node ID. OneFS 8.2 creates a file containing SSIP
information, the SSIP Resource File. To host an SSIP, a node must hold a lock on this
file. All the nodes that are ready to host an SSIP, attempt to lock the SSIP Resource File.
The first nodes to get the lock host the SSIP. The new process ensures the node
assignment is based on a lock to nodes within the subnet, avoiding the issues from
previous releases. Once the node is offline, or the interface goes down, the SSIP
becomes available for lock again, and the next quickest node to capture the lock hosts the
SSIP, as illustrated in the following figure. OneFS ensures that SSIPs are as evenly
distributed as possible within a subnet, using a feature to limit a single node from hosting
multiple SSIPs. In certain scenarios, a node may host more than a single SSIP,
depending on the number of nodes and SSIPs in the subnet.

SmartConnect considerations

OneFS 8.2 also introduces a new method for handling configuration and group changes.
In releases prior to OneFS 8.2, SmartConnect unconditionally stopped and unconfigured
the SSIP during a configuration or group change, and then evaluated where it should run,
which was frequently the same node. In OneFS 8.2, the SSIP remains in place through
configuration and group changes. After the changes, the SSIP moves only if necessary,
minimizing failover impacts.
To confirm which of the nodes are hosting SSIPs, use the following commands:
isi_for_array ifconfig | grep <SSIP>
isi_for_array ifconfig | grep “zone 0”

OneFS Release 9.4.0.0 introduces a new CLI command for troubleshooting
SmartConnect: isi network pools status. The new command lists SmartConnect
DNS resolvable status for each node. If a node is not resolvable, OneFS states possible
reasons, providing administrators a starting point to troubleshoot. The new command
uses the following format:
isi network pools status --id=[Subnet ID] –-show-all
The subnet ID is the ID listed under isi network pools list for the specified pool.
The isi network pools status command lists a summary of the pool and then a
status for each node, as displayed in Figure 27.

Figure 27. Network pools status
The status for each node lists if it is SmartConnect DNS resolvable, state, IP status,
interface status, protocols, and the suspended states. The possible states for each field
are listed in Table 10.

During SmartConnect configuration, consider the following points:
- Disable client DNS caching, when possible. To handle client requests properly,
SmartConnect requires that clients use the latest DNS entries. If clients cache
SmartConnect DNS information, they could connect to incorrect SmartConnect
zone names. In this event, SmartConnect might not appear to be functioning
correctly.
- If traffic is traversing firewalls, ensure that the appropriate ports are open. For
example, if UDP port 53 is opened, also ensure TCP port 53 is opened.
- Certain clients perform DNS caching and might not connect to the node with the
lowest load if they make multiple connections within the lifetime of the cached
address. For example, this issue occurs on macOS X for certain client
configurations.
- The site DNS servers must be able to communicate with the node that is currently
hosting the SmartConnect service.
- Site DNS servers might not exist in the regular local subnets, or in any of the
subnets that clients occupy. To enable the SmartConnect lookup process, ensure
that the DNS servers use a consistent route to the cluster and back. If the site DNS
server sends a lookup request that arrives through one local subnet on the cluster,
but the configured cluster routing causes the response to be sent through a
different subnet, it is likely that the packet will be dropped, and the lookup will fail.
The solutions and considerations for SmartConnect are similar to the client
scenarios. Also, the DNS server might benefit from a static route to the subnet that
contains the SSIP address or addresses.
- SmartConnect makes it possible for different nodes to have different default routes,
but this is fundamentally determined by connectivity. SmartConnect enables
administrators to define multiple gateways, with one gateway per subnet. Each
gateway is assigned a priority when it is defined. On any node, SmartConnect
attempts to use the highest priority gateway—the gateway that has the lowest
number—that has an available functioning interface in a subnet that contains the
gateway address.
- OneFS release 9.2 enhances the isi network interfaces list command,
providing an option to specify the type as SSIP, using the isi network
interfaces list --type SSIP command.
OneFS release 9.2 introduces support for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD). For more
information, see Duplicate Address Detection.

Ethernet, MTU, and IP overhead

## 51
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
Ethernet, MTU, and IP overhead

A Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is the largest packet size or frame that can be sent
along a link. The MTU is specified in octets and is used by TCP to determine the
maximum size of a packet per transmission. A large MTU provides less overhead
because packet headers and acknowledgments are not consuming space and bandwidth.
However, this could lead to retransmissions or drops if a hop does not support it. On the
contrary, a small MTU is not as efficient as overhead increases with packet headers and
acknowledgments.
Generally speaking, the MTU across the Internet is 1,500 bytes. As such, most devices
limit packet size to roughly 1,472 bytes, allowing for additional overhead and remaining
under the 1,500-byte limit. Additional overhead might be added as the packet goes
through different hops. The IEEE 802.3 standard also specifies 1,500 bytes as the
standard payload.

An Ethernet frame carries a payload of data and is carried by an Ethernet packet. The
frame could be IPv4 or IPv6 and TCP or UDP. The IEEE 802.3 standard defines the
structure of each packet. As a packet traverses different layers, the structure is modified
accordingly. In the following figure, the structure is displayed as it would traverse the wire,
or Layer 1. Dissecting how a packet is structured on the wire lends to an understanding of
how the packet overhead is affected and all the other components required to send a
payload.

Figure 28. Ethernet packet
An Ethernet packet on the wire at Layer 1 is composed of the following fields:
- Interpacket Gap: Serves as a gap between each frame, similar to a spacer. The
Interpacket gap is only part of Layer 1. The field originates from a time when hubs
were common, and collisions were more commonplace.
- Preamble: Composed of alternating 1 and 0 bits for receiver clock synchronization.
The Preamble is only part of Layer 1.
- Start Frame Delimiter: Identifies the start of an Ethernet frame.
- Destination MAC: Contains the MAC address of the destination station for which the
data is intended.
- Source MAC: Contains the MAC address of the sending station.
## Introduction
Ethernet packet

Ethernet, MTU, and IP overhead

52 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

- VLAN 802.1Q: Optional field used if a VLAN is identified.
- Type: Also known as the EtherType field, this defines the type of protocol that is
encapsulated in the payload. In the preceding example, it is an Ethernet II Frame,
the most widely accepted type.
- Payload: Spans from 46 to 1,500 bytes and contains user data. If it is smaller than
46 bytes, blank values are entered to bring this up to 46 bytes, which is the
minimum value. The Payload consists of protocol data for TCP, UDP, or RTP and
IPv4 or IPv6. The next section explains the Payload field in greater depth.
- CRC: Cyclic Redundancy Check is part of the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) to
detect errors within the frame. The CRC code should result in a zero if the data does
not contain any errors.

The Ethernet payload varies based on the type of data it is carrying. It is a combination of
either TCP, UDP, or RTP header combined with an IPv4 or IPv6 header, and most
importantly the actual payload which contains the data that is being sent. The fields within
the payload are displayed in the following figure:

Figure 29. Ethernet payload options
As shown in the figure, the amount of actual data sent within an Ethernet Frame is
dependent upon the number of bytes consumed by the other fields. Other options are
available which are not listed here. For example, Linux hosts automatically add a
timestamp to the TCP stack, adding 12 bytes.

Jumbo frames are Ethernet frames where the MTU is greater than the standard 1,500
bytes and a maximum of 9,000 bytes. The larger MTU provides greater efficiency
because less overhead and fewer acknowledgments are sent across devices, drastically
reducing interrupt load on endpoints. Jumbo frames are recommended for most
workloads because the amount of data sent per message is far greater, reducing
processing times and maximizing efficiency. While the general assumption is that jumbo
frames provide performance advantages for all workloads, measure results in a lab
environment simulating a specific workload to ensure performance enhancements.
For jumbo frames to take advantage of the greater efficiencies, they must be enabled
end-to-end on all hops between endpoints. Otherwise, the MTU could be lowered through
PMTUD or packets could be fragmented. The fragmentation and reassembly affect the
CPU performance of each hop, which affects the overall latency.

Jumbo frames

Ethernet, MTU, and IP overhead

## 53
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
For example, if a client is set to an MTU of 1,500 bytes while other hops are set to 9,000
bytes, transmission along the path will most likely set to 1,500 bytes using PMTUD,
unless other options are configured.
Jumbo frames use the same Ethernet packet structure described in the previous section.
However, the difference is the size of the data within the payload. The byte consumption
of the other components within the frame remains the same, while each packet contains
more data with the same overhead. A jumbo frame Ethernet payload is displayed in the
following figure:

Figure 30. Jumbo frames Ethernet payload

PowerScale nodes use 10, 25, and 40 GbE NICs for front-end networking. To maximize
throughput on these high-bandwidth links, jumbo frames are recommended for greater
throughput. Standard 1,500 byte and jumbo 9,000-byte packets are formed with the same
packet structure at Layer 1, with the only difference pertaining to the actual data payload.
Although the overhead is identical for standard and jumbo packets, the ratio of the data to
the overhead varies significantly.
For every payload sent to Layer 1 on the wire, the following fields are required:
Interpacket Gap / Preamble / Start Frame Delimiter / Destination MAC / Source MAC /
Type / CRC In bytes, this translates to:
12 + 7 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 4 = 38 bytes
Hence, regardless of the payload fields, every payload requires an additional 38 bytes to
be sent. This does not consider the optional VLAN tag, which requires an additional 4
bytes. The following sections provide examples of packet overhead based on the payload
fields.
Example 1: Standard 1,500-byte payload – IPv4/TCP
IPv4 and TCP headers consume the following bytes:
20 bytes (IPv4) + 20 bytes (TCP)= 40 bytes
If the payload headers consume 40 bytes, the data field for a standard 1,500-byte payload
consumes:
1500 – 40 = 1460 bytes

Therefore, a standard 1,500-byte packet with IPv4 and TCP headers results in a data to
Ethernet frame percentage as follows:
(Data Bytes) / (Total Ethernet Frame Bytes) = (1500 – 40) / (1500
## + 38) = 1460/1538 = .949 => 94.9%
Example 2: Jumbo 9,000-byte payload – IPv4/TCP
A 9,000-byte payload that contains IPv4 and TCP headers consumes the following bytes:
20 bytes (IPv4) + 20 bytes (TCP)= 40 bytes
If the payload headers consume 40 bytes, the data can field consumes:
9000 – 40 = 8960 bytes
Therefore, a 9,000-byte packet with IPv4 and TCP headers results in a data to Ethernet
frame percentage as follows:
Data Bytes) / (Total Ethernet Frame Bytes) = (9000 – 40) / (9000 +
## 38) = 8960/9038 = .991 => 99.1%
Example 3: Standard 1,500-byte payload – IPv4/TCP/Linux timestamp
Linux automatically inserts the timestamp within the payload. A standard 1,500-byte
payload that contains IPv4, TCP, and timestamp headers consumes the following bytes:
20 bytes (IPv4) + 20 bytes (TCP) + 12 bytes (timestamp) = 52 bytes
If the payload headers consume 40 bytes, the data field consumes:
1500 – 52 = 1448 bytes
Therefore, a standard 1,500-byte packet with IPv4 and TCP headers results in a data to
Ethernet frame percentage as follows:
(Data Bytes) / (Total Ethernet Frame Bytes) = (1500 – 52) / (1500
## + 38) = 1448/1538 = .941 => 94.1%
Example 4: Jumbo 9,000-byte payload – IPv4/TCP/Linux timestamp
Linux automatically inserts the timestamp within the payload. A 9,000-byte payload that
contains IPv4, TCP, and timestamp headers consumes the following bytes:
20 bytes (IPv4) + 20 bytes (TCP) + 12 bytes (timestamp) = 52 bytes
If the payload headers consume 40 bytes, the data field consumes:
9000 – 52 = 8948 bytes
Therefore, a 9,000-byte packet with IPv4 and TCP headers results in a data to Ethernet
frame percentage as follows:
(Data Bytes) / (Total Ethernet Frame Bytes) = (9000 – 52) / (9000
## + 38) = 8948/9038 = .990 => 99.0%

Based on the preceding calculations, the following table provides additional examples of
the amount of data that is sent per Ethernet frame for standard and jumbo frames.

Note: NFS v2 is UDP. NFS v3 and v4 are TCP. SMB is TCP.
As shown in the preceding table, jumbo frames deliver between 98 and 99 percent
efficiency depending on the packet type. The efficiencies are only maximized when all
hops from the client endpoint to a PowerScale node support jumbo frames. Otherwise,
packets might be fragmented, leading to additional processing overhead on devices or
PMTUD finding the lowest MTU along the path. Therefore, jumbo frames are
recommended for optimal performance. However, each workload environment is unique.
Measure performance enhancements in a lab before updating a production network.

Network devices employ Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to gather
communications-related information. ICMP is capable of sending error messages but also
delivers operational information. Ping and TraceRoute both send ICMP messages to
provide connectivity information including latency and network hops.
Most devices have a default MTU that is configurable and remains at the defined value.
PowerScale OneFS determines the MTU specific to each transaction. After the initial TCP
handshake, the PowerScale node sends an ICMP message for Path MTU Discovery
(PMTUD), RFC 1191, gathering the maximum supported MTU. If for any reason ICMP is
disabled, or PMTUD is not supported, this causes OneFS to default the MTU to 536
bytes, which typically leads to performance degradation.

To check the current configured MTU, enter the following command:

56 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

To modify the MTU, use the isi command with the following context:
isi network subnets modify groupnet0.subnet1 --mtu=1500 --
gateway=198.162.100.10
## --gateway-priority=1

VLAN-specific MTUs ensure a consistent MTU across all network device hops in a
session. OneFS allows multiple VLANs on a single interface, providing support for
multiple workloads. The interfaces support multiple VLANs and the associated MTUs for
those VLANs. A VLAN’s MTU must be less than or equal to the parent interface’s MTU. If
the parent interface is not explicitly configured, it will inherit the MTU of the VLAN with the
greatest MTU.

Manually checking a permitted MTU ensures a configured MTU is transmitted. The ping
command is used to confirm if an MTU can be transmitted. Start with the largest MTU and
work down to find the limit.
For example, to check if an MTU of 8900 bytes is transmitted to an endpoint, from the
OneFS CLI, use the following command: ping –s 8900 –D <IP Address>. The -s
specifies the packet size, and the -D specifies not to fragment the packet.
If the ping is successful, the MTU is transmitted across. If the ping is unsuccessful,
gradually lower the MTU until it is successfully transmitted. Verify that the MTU can be
transmitted from both endpoints.
OneFS is based on FreeBSD. FreeBSD also has options for gradually increasing the MTU
by performing a “sweeping ping” using the –g option. For more information about ping
options in FreeBSD, access the FreeBSD manual at the following link:
https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?ping(8)
Access zones best practices

When access zones are configured, a root-based path must be defined to segment data
into the appropriate access zone and enable the data to be compartmentalized. Access
zones carve out access to a PowerScale cluster creating boundaries for multitenancy or
multiprotocol. They permit or deny access to areas of the cluster. At the access zone
level, authentication providers are also provisioned.

When a PowerScale cluster is first configured, the System zone is created by default. The
System zone should only be used for management as a best practice. In certain special
cases, some protocols require the system zone, but generally speaking, all protocol traffic
should be moved to an access zone. If nothing else, NFS and SMB should have protocol-
specific access zones.
Moving client traffic to access zones ensures that the System zone is only used for
management and accessed by administrators. Access zones provide greater security
because administration and file access are limited to a subset of the cluster, rather than the
entire cluster.

Access zones best practices

## 57
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

SmartConnect zones map to access zones, which map to a root-based path. When an
access zone is defined, a root-based path must be defined. Best practice is to use the
cluster name, a numerical access zone number, and a directory. For example, Access
Zone 1 maps to /ifs/clustername/az1/<data directories>, Access Zone 2 maps to
/ifs/clustername/az2/<data directories>. A root-based path with this delineation provides
data separation and multitenancy, maintains the Unified Permission model, and makes
SyncIQ failover and failbacks easier.
Generally, the best practice is to remove all data access from the default System zone.
Otherwise, this leads to complications in the future as the cluster grows and additional
teams or workflows are added. Further, as previously mentioned, create a subdirectory
under the access zone, rather than using the root of the zone, to make migration and
disaster recovery simpler. It is preferred not to have an overlap of root-based paths unless
it is required for a specific workflow. Overlap is supported in 8.0 and newer releases
through the CLI.
In the following figure, as Cluster 1 fails over to Cluster 2, the directory structure remains
consistent, easily identifying where the files originated from. This delineation also ensures
clients have the same directory structure after a failover. Once the IP address is updated
in DNS, the failover is transparent to clients. As more clusters are brought together with
SyncIQ, this makes it easier to manage data, understanding where it originated from and
provides seamless disaster recovery.

with a root-based path in the following table:

Source-Based Routing considerations

Source-Based Routing (SBR) is a mechanism to dynamically create per-subnet default
routes. The router used as this gateway is derived from the subnet configuration.
Note: The naming convention of Source-Based Routing (SBR) suggests it routes packets based
on a source IP address. However, SBR creates per-subnet default routes.
SBR utilizes gateways that are defined for each subnet. For example, consider a cluster
with subnets A, B, and C, as illustrated in the following figure:

Figure 32. Source-Based Routing
## Overview

Source-Based Routing considerations

## 59
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
In the preceding example, each gateway has a defined priority. If SBR is not configured,
the highest priority gateway—that is, the gateway with the lowest value—which is
reachable, is used as the default route. Once SBR is enabled, firewall rules are added
when traffic arrives from a subnet that is not reachable using the default gateway. These
rules are added through ipfw. In the preceding example, the following ipfw rules are
provisioned:
If src-ip is in subnetA and dst-ip is not in (subnetA,B,C) set
next-hop to gatewayA

If src-ip is in subnetB and dst-ip is not in (subnetA,B,C) set
next-hop to gatewayB

If src-ip is in subnetC and dst-ip is not in (subnetA,B,C) set
next-hop to gatewayC
The process of adding ipfw rules is stateless and essentially translates to per-subnet
default routes. SBR is entirely dependent on the source IP address that is sending traffic
to the cluster. If a session is initiated from the source subnet, the ipfw rule is created.
The session must be initiated from the source subnet, otherwise the ipfw rule is not
created. If the cluster has not received traffic that originated from a subnet that is not
reachable using the default gateway, OneFS will transmit traffic it originates through the
default gateway.
Given how SBR creates per-subnet default routes, consider:
- A subnet setting of 0.0.0.0 is not supported and is severely problematic because
OneFS does not support RIP, RARP, or CDP.
- The default gateway is the path for all traffic intended for clients that are not on the
local subnet and not covered by a routing table entry. Utilizing SBR does not
negate the requirement for a default gateway because SBR in effect overrides the
default gateway, but not static routes.
- Static routes are an option when the cluster originates the traffic, and the route is
not accessible using the default gateway. It is important to note that static routes
are prioritized over source-based routing rules, as static routes are ipfw rules with
higher priority than the source-based routing rules.
- In environments where SBR is used with a DNS service presented on a remote
subnet and multiple SSIPs are present, every DNS server request to a different
SSIP changes the route back to the DNS service. Further, the DNS service is often
also on the same subnet as other services such as authentication provision, which
is likely to disrupt cluster operations. Consider providing SSIPs on a single subnet
to support all SmartConnect zones within a single groupnet or defining a static
route to the DNS server subnet[s].

Prior to OneFS Release 9.8.0.0, SBR was disabled by default. OneFS Release 9.8.0.0
enables SBR by default for all new (Greenfield) PowerScale deployments. Existing
(Brownfield) OneFS clusters upgrading to OneFS Release 9.8.0.0, maintain the existing
SBR setting. IPv6 support is also added to SBR in OneFS Release 9.8.0.0, whereas
previous releases only supported IPv4.
## Configuration

Source-Based Routing considerations

60 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

SBR may be configured through the WebUI or CLI. To configure SBR from the WebUI,
navigate to Cluster Management > Network Configuration and select the “Settings”
tab. Next, toggle the “Enable source based routing” checkbox to disable or enable SBR,
as displayed in the following figure.

Figure 33. Source based routing in the WebUI
To check if SBR is enabled from the CLI, use the isi network external view
command, as displayed in the following figure.

Figure 34. Checking SBR status from the CLI
To configure SBR from the CLI use the following command:
isi network external modify --sbr=[true/false]

As discussed earlier in this paper, it is important to understand the path a specific session
traverses throughout the network hierarchy. Having SBR configured on a cluster also
affects how the cluster creates sessions with other hosts, such as a DNS server.

Routing and DNS

PowerScale front end InfiniBand (IB)

## 61
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
In certain environments, PowerScale clusters with SBR enabled and multiple
SmartConnect SIP (SSIP) addresses, have experienced excessive latency with DNS
responses. As mentioned previously in this paper, keeping latency minimal is imperative
through any transaction and the delayed DNS responses could affect DNS-dependent
workflows. The prior section explained how SBR dynamically assigns a gateway. In this
instance, the route to the DNS server is changed as the session originated on a different
interface based on the SSIP being addressed.
To prevent the additional latency with DNS responses when SBR is enabled with multiple
SSIP addresses, consider the following recommendations:
- If a single access zone is configured to have multiple SmartConnect zones and
multiple subnets with SBR enabled, use a single SSIP.
- If a cluster is using a single DNS server, use a single SSIP.
- If multiple access zones are required within a single groupnet, use a single SSIP.
PowerScale front end InfiniBand (IB)
InfiniBand is a high-performance communication protocol renowned for its exceptional
data transfer rates and ultra-low latency, often used in high-performance computing
(HPC) and data-intensive applications. Starting from OneFS 9.10, PowerScale platform
support to use InfiniBand as the front end network. Application can access to PowerScale
cluster data by leveraging existing InfiniBand infrastructure.

Isilon 6th generation 1 GbE interfaces

62 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations


Figure 36. F910 with front end IB NIC: Rear view
## Isilon 6
th
generation 1 GbE interfaces
The Isilon Gen 6 platform provides a single 1 GbE interface per node. The original intent
of the interface was to provide SSH access to the cluster. However, against best practice,
many cluster configurations use these interfaces for data access, either intentionally or
unintentionally.
The 1 GbE interface was not designed for data transfer because the chipset does not
support TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) and Large Receive Offload (LRO), increasing
the chances of dropped packets, port flapping, and other performance issues. TSO and
LRO are available on the 10 GbE and 40 GbE ports, which are optimized for data traffic.
Note: The 1 GbE interfaces on Isilon Gen 6 nodes should not be used for data transfer under any
circumstances. During the initial cluster configuration, if possible, do not configure the 1 GbE
interface. If the interface must be enabled, it should only be used for WebUI and SSH access.
As a best practice, the 1 GbE interfaces should not be configured. During the initial cluster
configuration, only configure the 10 GbE and 40 GbE interfaces. If the 1 GbE interface
must be used for the initial cluster configuration, after the cluster is configured, remove the
1 GbE interfaces from all IP pools.
If the 1 GbE interfaces must be configured:
- Configure the interfaces on a separate dedicated VLAN or subnet.
- The 1 GbE interfaces should not share an IP pool with the 10 GbE and 40 GbE
interfaces.
- Configure a Gateway Priority for the 1 GbE interfaces subnet. Set the priority to the
highest value of all the cluster’s subnets, ensuring the 1 GbE interfaces only carry
traffic under scenarios where all the other cluster interfaces are unavailable.
- Consider disabling SMB3 Multi-Channel (MC). During the client connection
process, SMB3 MC provides all IP addresses across subnets, including the 1 GbE
interfaces.
Clusters using the 1 GbE interfaces for anything other than WebUI and SSH access
experience overall performance degradation. Protocol performance suffers if traffic is
routed through the 1 GbE interface. SyncIQ reports random failures because it might
communicate through the 1 GbE interfaces, even if a policy is configured not to use those
interfaces. Performance degradation might also affect authentication, SRS, CEE, anti-
virus, and CloudPools.

## Intelligent Platform Management Interface

## 63
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
Another factor to consider for leaving the 1 GbE interface unconfigured is that starting with
OneFS release 8.0, the bge driver for the 1 GbE interface increments InputDiscards for
unwanted packets, such as multicast and spanning-tree packets. The InputDiscards show
as errors under the netstat -in command, complicating the cluster network monitoring.
## Intelligent Platform Management Interface

OneFS 9.0 introduces support for the Intelligent Platform Module Interface (IPMI) on 6th
generation Isilon nodes and PowerScale nodes. IPMI provides a dedicated management
channel for lights-out management, external to OneFS. The supported IPMI features are
power control and Serial over LAN (SoL).
Once IPMI is configured through OneFS, it can be accessed through the IPMItool, which
is part of most Linux distributions, or other proprietary IPMI tools. On Gen 6 Isilon nodes,
the 1 GbE interface becomes dual personality, continuing to support management, but
now also supports IPMI. For PowerScale nodes, the 1 GbE iDRAC port provides support
for IPMI.

Figure 37. IPMI access for Gen 6 and PowerScale nodes
Before configuring IPMI, consider the following information:
- Configuring the SoL feature on PowerScale nodes does require a node reboot to
access and configure the serial communication settings.
- IPMI SoL is an alternative to physical serial cable access, but it is not a
replacement for traditional SSH access to the cluster. Also, SoL is not available for
initial cluster configuration because IPMI is disabled from the factory and must be
enabled after initial cluster configuration.
- Gen 6 Isilon nodes require a Node Firmware Package at a minimum of v10.3.2.
- Configuring IPMI does require the ISI_PRIV_IPMI RBAC level, which is part of the
Configuration privilege level.
- The IPMI IP address space cannot be on the same subnet as any of the cluster's
front-end networks.
- On Gen 6 nodes, during an active SoL session, the physical serial port is disabled.
Once the active SoL session is deactivated, the physical serial port becomes active
again. Only a single SoL session is supported per node. On PowerScale nodes, the

physical serial interface is disabled after the BIOS update explained in Configure
serial devices.
- A power reset may be issued through SoL, using only the IPMI password for
access.
- IPMI does not support VLAN tagging.
- As a security best practice, isolate IPMI traffic to a management only VLAN.
- At the initial login of the SoL session, the user is prompted for the OneFS CLI
username and password. If the user logs out of the SoL session without logging out
of the CLI, the CLI session remains active, allowing the next SoL session to enter
the OneFS CLI without authenticating. As a security best practice, log out of the
OneFS CLI session prior to logging out of the SoL session.
- Rebooting a node through SoL provides the full output of the entire OneFS
shutdown and bootup sequence.
For releases prior to OneFS 9.0, IPMI is available for Gen 6 nodes as a manual
configuration on each node. It is not officially supported, but it is also not prohibited, and it
generally works. For OneFS 9.0, this process is an automated cluster configuration for all
nodes within a cluster. If IPMI was configured on a release prior to OneFS 9.0, upgrading
to 9.0 does not affect any existing IPMI configuration.

From the OneFS CLI, to configure IPMI, perform the following steps:
- Enable IPMI and configure the IPMI IP addresses with static or DHCP allocation:
isi ipmi settings modify --enabled=True --allocation
type=[dhcp/static]
If IPMI is configured with static IP addresses, specify the IP range:
isi ipmi network modify --gateway=[Gateway IP] --prefixlen= -
-ranges=[IP Range]
Note: Assigning a specific IP address to a certain node might not be possible because IP
addresses are assigned on a first-come basis. To confirm a specific node’s IP address, run
the following command: isi impi nodes list
- Enable the selected IPMI features:
isi ipmi features modify Power-Control --enabled=True isi
ipmi features modify SOL --enabled=True
Note: For PowerScale nodes, SoL requires additional configuration. See IPMI SoL on
PowerScale nodes, after completing all steps in this section.
- Confirm the enabled IPMI features:
isi ipmi features list

- Configure a single IPMI username and password for all nodes. The IPMI
authentication is not part of any of the other OneFS authentication providers. It is
only for IPMI access. Usernames up to 16 characters are supported. Passwords
must be more than 16 characters and less than 21 characters. Configure an IPMI
username and password:
isi ipmi user modify --username=[Username] --set-password
- Confirm a username is configured:
isi ipmi user view

IPMI Serial over LAN (SoL) is enabled through the OneFS CLI, as explained in
Configuring IPMI. Once enabled, PowerScale nodes (F200/F600) require additional steps
for activating SoL on each node in a cluster.
Configure serial devices
In order for IPMI SoL to function, the physical serial devices must be configured to support
SoL on each node in the cluster.
Note: On PowerScale nodes, the physical serial port is no longer active after the BIOS
configuration updates provided in this section.
The serial communication settings should be configured per the values specified in the
following table. For PowerScale nodes that do not have iDRAC configured, the serial
communication settings are accessed during node boot up by selecting F2, entering the
System BIOS, and selecting Serial Communication. For PowerScale nodes with iDRAC
configured, the serial communication settings are found under iDRAC > Configuration >
BIOS Settings. Update the serial communication settings per the following table and
repeat for each node in the cluster.

iDRAC SoL permission
After the serial communication settings are configured, the IPMI username created in
Configuring IPMI requires SoL permission through iDRAC. From the iDRAC Settings
window, select the Users tab. Edit the IPMI username to have Serial over LAN enabled,
as displayed in the following figures:

The iDRAC settings must be updated on each PowerScale node in a cluster. Continue
updating the iDRAC setting of each PowerScale node by accessing
https://<node_IPMI_IP_address>:443.

Once IPMI is configured, it can be accessed through third-party proprietary tools, or most
commonly through the ipmitool command in Linux. The ipmitool command is
included in most Linux distributions.
To manage an Isilon or PowerScale node through IPMI, from a Linux endpoint, use the
following syntax:
ipmitool -I lanplus -H [Node IP] -U [Username] -L OPERATOR -P
[password] power [status, on, off, cycle, reset]

ipmitool -I lanplus -H [Node IP] -U [Username] -L OPERATOR -P
[password] sol [info, activate, deactivate]
To exit an active SoL session, enter the following characters (including the period):
## ~.
To check if a node has an active SoL connection, run the following command:

OneFS host-based firewall
PowerScale OneFS Release 9.5.0.0 introduces a host-based firewall for cluster security.
A perimeter-based firewall is recommended as a best practice in addition to the OneFS
host-based firewall. The perimeter-based firewall continues to protect the private network
from a public network. A host-based firewall takes security a step further to protect the
host from any threats within the private network.

OneFS host-based firewall

## 67
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

Firewall rules specific to a PowerScale cluster can be configured according to security
requirements. The OneFS host-based firewall only applies to the front-end network,
because the back-end network is on a separate dedicated network without other devices.

The OneFS host-based firewall is composed of firewall rules and policies. A firewall rule is
used to specify a matching criterion for IP packets and an associated action. The
matching criteria for a rule can be the following:
- Protocol: The protocol can be TCP, UDP, ICMP, ICMP6, or ALL.
- Source ports: The source port numbers of the incoming IP packet.
- Destination ports: The destination port numbers of the incoming IP packet.
- Source network address: The IP address of the incoming IP packet.
The associated actions for the matching criteria of a rule are the following:
- Deny: A deny action simply drops the packets at the NIC before they enter the
PowerScale cluster.
- Reject: A reject action drops the packets similarly to the deny action, but also sends
an ICMP error code to the sender.
- Allow: An allow action permits the packet to enter the PowerScale node.
A firewall policy can contain multiple firewall rules. The rules are matched by index in
ascending order. While each firewall rule has an associated action, the policy has a user-
defined default action, if none of the firewall rules apply. The firewall policy default action
may be deny, reject, or allow an IP packet from any to any. A firewall policy is assigned to
a network pool and subnet, as shown in the following figure.

Figure 40. Firewall policy and rules
By default, OneFS has a Default Pools Policy (default_pools_policy) and a Default
Subnets Policy (default_subnets_policy), as shown in the following figure. The Default
Pools Policy enforces the port numbers and protocols required for OneFS services, as
listed in the Security Configuration Guide, found under the respective OneFS software
release at OneFS Info Hubs.
The Default Subnets Policy (default_subnets_policy) applies to SSIPs and provides rules
for the following:
- DNS Port 53
## • ICMP
## • ICMP6
## Introduction
## Architecture

OneFS host-based firewall

68 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

Important: Network Pools do not inherit firewall policies or rules from the firewall policy associated
with their respective subnets
Network pools and network subnets always belong to a single firewall policy. This can
either be a custom policy, or a default policy. If a subnet or pool is removed from a policy,
it is automatically added to the default policy.

Figure 41. Default firewall policies
An administrator can modify both the Default Pools Policy and the Default Subnets Policy.
The default policies are only used when the pool or subnet does not have a custom policy
assigned, because each subnet or pool must have a policy assigned. OneFS also
provides an option to revert the default policies to factory defaults, with the isi network
firewall reset global policy command.

The OneFS host-based firewall is disabled by default for brownfield and greenfield
clusters running OneFS Release 9.5.0.0. An administrator with the ISI_PRIV_FIREWALL
privilege can enable the feature. By default, the ISI_PRIV_FIREWALL privilege is
assigned to SystemAdmin with write permission and to AuditAdmin with read
permission.
Note: As a best practice, rather than creating a new firewall policy from scratch, it is
recommended to use the default policies as a baseline of threat protection for OneFS services. An
option to clone policies is available. When the default policy is cloned, administrators can add
additional rules specific to the environment. Also note that changes made to a firewall policy take
place immediately. To avoid accidental misconfigurations, it is advised always to make changes
by cloning a firewall policy, editing the cloned policy, then reconfiguring pools to the new policy.
Both the CLI and WebUI support the configuration for the OneFS host-based firewall. See
the appropriate following section for the configuration steps.
## CLI
You can configure the OneFS host-based firewall in the CLI by using the isi network
firewall commands. List the current firewall settings by using the isi network
firewall settings view command.
Note: Enabling the firewall automatically applies the default firewall policies. As explained in the
Architecture section, the default firewall policies enforce the port numbers and protocols required
for OneFS services, as listed in the Security Configuration Guide, found under the respective
OneFS software release at OneFS Info Hubs. Before enabling the firewall, ensure that the default
port numbers and protocols do not conflict with any custom port or protocol configuration.
## Configuration

OneFS host-based firewall

## 69
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
Enable the OneFS host-based firewall with the isi network firewall settings
modify --enabled true command. To create a firewall policy and rules, do the
following:
- Before creating custom firewall rules, clone the default firewall policy with the isi
network firewall policies clone command. If necessary, you can create
a new firewall policy with the isi network firewall policies create
command, although the default policy provides a baseline of threat protection.
- When the firewall policy is cloned or created, you can add rules to the policy with
the isi network firewall rules create command.
- Apply a firewall policy to pools and subnets using the isi network firewall
policies modify command and the add-pools or add-subnets options.
To prevent accidentally modifying active firewall policies and rules, the CLI requires a --
live parameter to be specified when modifying an in-use firewall policy or rule.
(Providing the --live parameter when modifying an inactive firewall policy or rule is
considered an error.)
WebUI
The WebUI configuration for the host-based firewall is located under Cluster
Management > Firewall Configuration, as shown here.

Figure 42. WebUI firewall configuration
If the firewall is not yet configured, a banner directs the user to the “Settings” tab.
Note: Enabling the firewall automatically applies the default firewall policies. As explained in the
Architecture section, the default firewall policies enforce the port numbers and protocols required
for OneFS services, as listed in the Security Configuration Guide, found under the respective
OneFS software release at OneFS Info Hubs. Before enabling the firewall, ensure that the default
port numbers and protocols do not conflict with any custom port or protocol configuration.
To enable the firewall, navigate to the Settings tab and enable the “Firewall policies on
the cluster” toggle as shown in the following figure.

OneFS host-based firewall

Figure 43. Enabling firewall
To create a firewall policy and rules, do the following:
- Before creating custom firewall rules, clone the default firewall policy by selecting
the Firewall Policies tab under Cluster Management > Firewall Configuration.
Next, under More Actions, select Clone Policy for the associated policy. From the
Clone Policy window, specify a policy name and description as shown here.

Troubleshooting and logs
To troubleshoot the firewall feature, more information is available in the following logs:
- /var/log/isi_firewall_d.log – Contains information about the firewall
daemon
- /var/log/isi_papi_d.log – Contains information for all PAPI handlers, but
also includes firewall handlers.
- isi_gconfig -t firewall – This command displays the firewall configuration.


If a OneFS cluster has the firewall disabled and the STIG security profile is applied, the
firewall is enabled automatically. If the firewall is already enabled when the STIG security
profile is applied, the firewall continues to be enabled.
For more information about the STIG security profile, see the Dell PowerScale OneFS:
Security Considerations white paper.

IPv6

## 73
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

ICMP6 is a critical component of IPv6 because it allows the Neighbor Discovery Protocol
(NDP). The default global firewall policies include an ICMP6 rule by default. If a custom
policy is created with a cluster that has IPv6 subnets and pools, the ICMP6 rule must be
added to the policy. The best practice is to clone the global policy and customize rules,
accordingly allowing for a baseline of necessary rules. For more information about IPv6,
see the
IPv6 section.

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) service in OneFS can run in active or passive mode. By
default, the OneFS FTP service runs in passive mode, which conflicts with how the host-
based firewall runs. Before enabling the firewall, enable active mode for the FTP service,
with the isi ftp setting modify --active-mode true command. Depending
on the FTP client types, converting to active mode might be required.

The default firewall global policies have the default ports for each OneFS service. OneFS
allows for the SSH, HTTP, S3, and NDMP port numbers to be updated. If any of the
default port settings have been changed to accommodate specific environmental
requirements, the port settings must also be updated in the global policies.
Note: As port numbers of critical services are changed, understand that the service is blocked
when the rule is updated. For example, consider if the port number for SSH is changed through an
active SSH session. Be sure to practice caution with the --live parameter in the CLI, because
changes may impact an active management session.

The Source-Based Routing (SBR) and firewall features in OneFS can be enabled or
disabled independently. Although both features are part of the ipfw table, they use
different partitions of the ipfw table, allowing each feature to be independent. For
more information about SBR, see the Source-Based Routing considerations section.
IPv6

Although Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the most common version of IP today,
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the newest version and ultimately replaces IPv4. IPv4
addresses were allocated to specific geographic regions in 2011. IPv6 uses 128-bit
addresses supporting 340 undecillion addresses. For those unfamiliar with an undecillion,
this translates to 340 times 10 to the 36th-power possible IP addresses.

IPv6 brings innovation and takes connectivity to a new level with enhanced user
experiences.
## Security
IPv6 supports IPSEC inherently with encryption and integrity checks. Also, the Secure
Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol provides cryptographic confirmation of host identity,
minimizing hostname-based attacks like Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning,
leading to devices placing more trust in connections.

## Introduction
Why IPv6?

IPv6

74 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

## Efficiency
IPv6’s large address space means many devices no longer require NAT translation, as
required with IPv4, making routers far more efficient. Overall data transmission is faster
and simplified because the need for checking packet integrity is eliminated.
## Multicast
IPv6 supports multicast rather than broadcast, allowing media streams to be sent to
multiple destinations simultaneously leading to bandwidth savings.
Quality of Service
Quality of Service (QoS) implementation is simplified in IPv6 with a new packet header.
The IPv6 header contains a new field, Flow Label, which identifies packets belonging to
the same flow. The Flow Label associates packets from a specific host and head to a
particular destination.

IPv6’s address structure is defined by the IETF as part of RFC 3513 and provides many of
the previously discussed advantages over IPv4. At first glance, it is evident an IPv6
address looks nothing like an IPv4 address. IPv4 addresses are composed of four
numerical octets, ranging from 0 to 255, separated by periods, forming a 32-bit address.
IPv6 addresses are 128 bits and consisting of a series of eight segments, separated by a
colon. Each segment is a 4-character hexadecimal number, ranging from 0000 to FFFF,
representing 16 bits each, totaling to the 128 bits.

Figure 47. IPv6 address
For display purposes, an IPv6 address may be presented without leading zeros. For
example, an IPv6 address of 2001 : 0DC8: E004 : 0001 : 0000 : 0000 : 0000
: F00A could be displayed as 2001 : DC8: E004 : 1 : 0 : 0 : 0 : F00A.
The address may be further reduced by removing consecutive fields of zeros and
replacing with a double- colon. The double-colon can only be used once in an address.
The address becomes 2001 : DC8 : E004 : 1 :: F00A.
IPv6 offers the following address types:
- Unicast: one-to-one – Single Address to Single Interface
- Anycast: one-to-nearest – Assigned to a group of interfaces, with packets being
delivered only to a single (nearest) interface
- Multicast: one-to-many – Assigned to a group of interfaces and is typically delivered
across multiple hosts.
An IPv6 Unicast address is composed of the Global Routing Prefix, Subnet ID, and the
Interface Identifier. The Global Routing Prefix is the network ID or prefix of the address for
routing. The Subnet ID is similar to the netmask in IPv4 but is not part of the IP address in
IPv6 addressing

IPv6

## 75
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
IPv6. Finally, the Interface ID is a unique identifier for a particular interface. For Ethernet
networks, the Ethernet MAC address (48 bits) may be used for the Interface Identifier, by
inserting 16 additional bits, forming what is referred to as an EUI-64 address.

Figure 48. IPv6 Unicast address format

An IPv6 header is simplified in comparison to IPv4, minimizing complexity and making the
header easier to process for all devices. Efficiency was one of the focus points with IPv6
from the onset, which is brought to light with the faster processing of IPv6 headers. The
following figure displays the format of an IPv6 header:

Figure 49. IPv6 header
The following table defines the fields of an IPv6 header:
Table 15. IPv6 header fields
## Field Description Length
Version Specifies if the packet is IPv4 or IPv6 4 Bits
Traffic Class Similar to an IPv4 Type of Service field and includes
support for Differentiated Services Code Point
(DSCP) providing congestion control
## 8 Bits
Flow Label Provides the ability to track certain traffic flows at the
network layer for QoS management
## 20 Bits
## Payload Length
Similar to the IPv4 Length field – Provides length of
the data portion
## 16 Bits
Next Header Similar to the IPv4 Protocol field – Provides what
to expect after the basic header, including options for
a TCP or UDP header
## 8 Bits
Hop Limit Similar to the IPv4 Time to Live field – Provides
the maximum number of hops
## 8 Bits

Connecting IPv6 and IPv4 remains a challenge with the slow migration to IPv6 and
support for legacy devices requiring IPv4. The three top options available to facilitate IPv4
and IPv6 communication are dual-stack networks, tunneling, and translation.
For Service Providers to deliver IPv6, they use translation technologies. The two major
translation technologies are the Network Address Translation IPv6 to IPv4 (NAT64) and
IPv6 header
IPv6 to IPv4
translation

IPv6

76 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

Stateless IP/ICMP Translation (SIIT). NAT64 is similar to the IPv4 Network Address
Translation but is specific to IPv6. SIIT is capable of replacing IPv4 and IPv6 as part of the
translation.
In OneFS release 9.5.0.0 and later IPv6 is disabled by default for new clusters, unless
IPv6 is configured during the initial cluster configuration wizard. For existing clusters that
upgrade to OneFS release 9.5.0.0, the current IPv6 configuration remains intact. In
OneFS release 9.5.0.0 and later, once IPv6 is enabled on a new cluster, the IPv6 sub-
options must also be enabled manually. IPv6 options are configured using the isi
network external commands.

PowerScale OneFS release 9.2.0.0 introduces support for IPv6 Router Advertisements
(RAs). OneFS uses the RAs to update IPv6 routes. Although RAs might provide
information about how to configure an IPv6 IP address using SLAAC or DHCPv6, OneFS
does not use this functionality.
Note: OneFS only updates IPv6 routes if RAs are available on the front-end external network.
Greenfield OneFS release 9.2.0.0 clusters have the RAs feature enabled by default. For
brownfield OneFS release 9.2.0.0 clusters, the RAs feature is disabled by default,
preventing any existing configuration impacts. To enable the RAs feature on a brownfield
OneFS release 9.2 cluster, run the following command:
isi network external modify --ipv6-auto-config-enabled=true
To confirm if the RAs feature is enabled, check for the ACCEPT_ROUTER_ADVERT NIC
flag on the isi network interfaces list –-v command, as shown here:

Figure 50. ACCEPT_ROUTER_ADVERT flag

IPv6 uses Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) to detect conflicting IP addresses.
PowerScale OneFS release 9.2.0.0 introduces support for Duplicate Address Detection
(DAD). The DAD feature is disabled by default. To enable the DAD feature, use the
isi_sysctl_cluster net.inet6.ip6.dad_count= command, where the
dad_count value is the number of seconds. In OneFS release 9.5.0.0 and later, the
isi_sysctl_cluster command is replaced by isi network external and the
DAD option is specified with –-ipv6-dad-timeout.

## 77
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations
A value greater than zero for this command enables the DAD feature. It specifies the
number of seconds OneFS checks for duplicate IP addresses when an IP address is
initially configured. Setting the value to zero disables the DAD feature.
Note: The dynamic IP allocation method is not recommended with the DAD feature because it
could lead to a DU event. The DU event occurs due to a potential race case in how dynamic IPs
move between nodes leading to a false positive duplicated address. If this occurs, the IP will be
unavailable until it moves again or is manually removed from the interface using ifconfig.
OneFS detects duplicate IP addresses on the front-end network through detection states.
After an IP address is configured, OneFS sets the IP address to a tentative state.
OneFS cannot listen on the IP address during the tentative state as it checks for a
duplicate. If a duplicate is found, a duplicated flag is set on the IP address. If no
duplicate IP addresses are found, the tentative flag is cleared, and OneFS starts
listening on the IP address. The tentative and duplicated flags are displayed under
the ifconfig command. Also, check the /var/log/messages kernel logs mentioning
DAD complete.
The DAD feature also applies to SmartConnect SSIP addresses. If a duplicate SSIP
address is detected, OneFS logs and removes the IP address. To confirm, check the
/var/log/isi_smartconnect log file and search for duplicate address
detection. Confirm SmartConnect has removed the SSIP by using the isi network
interfaces list --type SSIP command.
Note: Dynamic IP and SSIP failover windows are increased by the number of seconds specified in
the preceding sysctl command. OneFS allows the DAD process to complete before listening on
an IP address.
Network troubleshooting

This section provides steps for assessing and troubleshooting network issues with
generally available utilities.

Short for network statistics, netstat is a utility that is built into most Windows and Linux
clients. It provides an array of statistics on current ports, routing, IP stats for transport
layer protocols, and serves as a forensic tool to link processes with network performance
while digging deeper into the current network status. The netstat utility bundles several
actions into a single command, with different options available. Because netstat is
multiplatform, the syntax is similar across platforms with slight variations.
Standard netstat
In its standard form without any arguments, netstat provides an overview of the current
network status broken out by each connection or socket. Each column displays the
following information:
- Proto: Protocol of the active connection. The protocol could be TCP or UDP and
has a 4 or 6 associated, specifying if it is IPv4 or IPv6, respectively.
## Introduction
netstat

Network troubleshooting

78 Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

- Recv-Q and Send-Q: Value of the receiving and sending queue in bytes. Nonzero
values specify the number of bytes in the queue that are awaiting to be processed.
The preferred value is zero. If several connections have nonzero values, this
implies something is causing processing to be delayed.
- Local Address and Foreign Address: Lists the hosts and ports the sockets are
connected with. Some of these are local connections to the host itself.
- State: Displays the current state of the TCP connection, based on the TCP
protocol. Because UDP is a stateless protocol, the State column will be blank for
UDP connections. The most common TCP states include:
▪ Listen: Waiting for an external device to establish a connection.
▪ Established: Ready for communication on this connection.
▪ Close Wait: The remote machine has closed the connection, but the local
device has not closed the connection yet.
▪ Time Wait: The local machine is waiting for a period of time after sending an
ACK to close a connection.
For more information about the states of a TCP connection, see RFC 793.

Figure 51. netstat
The netstat utility reveals a lot of information about the status of network connections, and
it also provides information for a more thorough forensic analysis. Based on the output
from netstat, some of the scenarios can be generalized. For example:
- Recv-Q has a value greater than zero but is in a Close Wait state. This indicates
that these sockets should be torn down but are hanging. If several sockets are in
this state, the application might be having difficulty tearing down the connection,
warranting additional investigation.
- Connections that have localhost as the Local and Foreign address denote an
internal process using the TCP stack to communicate. These connections are not
concerning and are standard practice.
netstat -s -p tcp
The netstat utility offers several options, but the -s provides statistics by protocol and -p
displays the net to media tables. These options reveal current health, and tcp limits it to
the TCP protocol. The following figure shows a sample output of this command with the
areas to examine highlighted in red.

Network troubleshooting

## 79
Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations

Figure 52. netstat -s -p tcp
The fields highlighted in red in the preceding figure must be reviewed as a ratio of the total
packets that are transmitted and received as a percentage. Also, these statistics should
be monitored for sudden increments. As a guideline, under 1 percent is not concerning,
but this also depends on the workload. The fields highlighted in the preceding figure
provide the following information:
- Retransmitted packets: Packets that are retransmitted consume network bandwidth
and could be the reason for further investigation. However, examining the
percentage is critical. In this case, 249379 out of 235829612 were retransmitted,
which is 0.105 percent.
- Duplicate acknowledgements: High latency between endpoints might lead to
duplicate acknowledgments, but the ratio must be examined. In this case, it is 0.419
percent. This number varies depending on the workload.
- Out-of-order packets: Out-of-order packets are placed in order by TCP before being
presented to the application layer. This activity affects the CPU and overall stack
performance because of the additional effort involved in analyzing the packets.
Performance is most affected when packets arrive out of order with a significant
time gap or when several packets are out of order. The ratio, in this case, is 0.197
percent, which is negligible.
netstat -i
Another option for netstat is the –i option, which is the interface display, listing cumulative
statistics for total packets transferred, errors, MTU, and collisions by the interface.
Because netstat –i lists all available interfaces, the back-end, and front-end interfaces
are displayed. The following figure shows a sample output of netstat –i with the –h
option, making it easier to interpret:

- Name: Network Interface Card (NIC) name. Loopback interfaces are listed as lo0,
and ib specifies InfiniBand.
- MTU: Lists the MTU specified for the interface.
- Network: Specifies the network associated with the interface.
- Address: MAC address of the interface.
- Ipkts: Input packets are the total number of packets received by this interface.
- Ierrs: Input errors are the number of errors reported by the interface when
processing the Ipkts. These errors include malformed packets, buffer space
limitation, checksum errors, errors generated by media, and resource limitation
errors. Media errors are errors specific to the physical layer, such as the NIC,
connection, cabling, or switch port. Resource limitation errors are generated at peak
traffic when interface resources are exceeded by usage.
- Idrop: Input drops are the number of packets that were received, but not processed
and therefore dropped on the wire. Dropped packets typically occur during heavy
load.
- Opkts: Output packets are the total number of packets transmitted by this interface
- Oerrs: Output errors are the number of errors reported by the interface when
processing the Opkts. Examples of errors include the output queue reaching limits
or an issue with the host.
- Coll: Collisions are the number of packet collisions that are reported. Collisions
typically occur during a duplex mismatch or during high network utilization.
In general, errors and dropped packets require closer examination. However, as noted in
the previous netstat section, the percentage of errors and percentage of dropped packets
are the main factors. For further analysis, consider:
- Ierrs should typically be less than 1 percent of the total Ipkts. If greater than
1 percent, check netstat –m for buffer issues and consider increasing the receive
buffers. Before implementing changes on a production system, test buffer changes
in a lab environment. See PowerScale network stack tuning for additional details.
- Oerrs should typically be less than 1 percent of the total Opkts. If greater than
1 percent, it could be a result of network saturation, otherwise consider increasing
the send queue size.

- The ratio of Coll to Opkts should typically be less than 10 percent. If greater than
10 percent, it could be a result of high network utilization.
netstat -m
The netstat –m option displays the status of network memory requests as mbuf
clusters. netstat –m is a powerful option for a complete forensic analysis when one of
the other netstat commands previously mentioned raises concern. If mbufs are
exhausted, the node cannot accept any additional network traffic.

Figure 54. netstat -m
The netstat –m output provides information in regard to available and used mbufs. The
area highlighted in red confirms if any memory requests have been denied. In the
preceding example, a quick glance at this area reveals that no requests have been
denied.
For more information about netstat options, see the FreeBSD manual netstat page at
https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=netstat&manpath=SuSE+Linux/i386+11.3.

PowerScale InsightIQ reports external network errors under the Performance Reporting
tab when Network Performance Report is selected. A sample of this output is displayed
in the following figure:

Figure 55. InsightIQ network errors
InsightIQ gathers network errors using the output from netstat –i on external
interfaces only. The total of the Ierrs and Oerrs is combined and displayed in the
graph. See the previous section for interpreting the output from netstat –i.
To find the exact interface errors, sort the graph by Node, Direction, and Interface,
as shown in the following figures:

DNS or Domain Name Service resolves hostnames to IP addresses. Most enterprises
have a local DNS to resolve hostnames managed by them, and then a public Internet
DNS resolves external hostnames.
Troubleshooting DNS is performed with the utilities, nslookup or dig. Both provide
similar information; however, dig is more detailed. In this section, the usage of dig is
explored.

Figure 59. dig dell.com
The dig command displays results in the following sections:
- Header: The Header provides the version of dig, options that the dig command
used, and the flags that are displayed.
- Question Section: The Question Section displays the original input provided to the
command. In the preceding example, dell.com was queried. The default is to query
the DNS A record. Other options are available for querying MX and NS records.
- Answer Section: The Answer Section is the output received by dig from the DNS
server queried.
- Authority Section: The Authority Section lists the available Name Servers of
dell.com. They have the authority to respond to this query.
- Additional Section: The Additional Section resolves the hostnames from the
Authority Section to IP addresses.

- Stats Section: The footer at the end of the query is referred to as the Stats Section.
It displays the query time, when the query was run, the server that responded, and
the message size.
The dig command supports an array of options. The most common options include a
reverse look-up using dig –x [IP address] to find a host name. The other is to
specify a DNS server to query using dig @[dns server] [hostname].
For the complete list of dig options, see the FreeBSD manual page.
