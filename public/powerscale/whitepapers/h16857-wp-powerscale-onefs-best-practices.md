Data layout recommendations

6 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
Data layout recommendations

In general, it is more efficient to create a deep directory hierarchy that consolidates files in
balanced subdirectories than it is to spread files out over a shallow subdirectory structure.
Although the recommended maximum file limit per directory is one million, a best practice
is to constrain the number of files in any one directory to one hundred thousand. A
maximum of 100,000 directories per directory is also recommended. OneFS dynamically
allocates new inodes from free file system blocks.
The key for file and directory layout always revolves around balance. The goal should be
for a directory tree structure and is file contents to be as uniform as possible.
- Storing large numbers of files in a directory may affect enumeration and performance,
but whether performance is affected depends on workload, workflow, applications,
tolerance for latency, and other factors. To better handle storing a large number of
files in a directory, use nodes that contain solid state drives (SSDs).
- Directory tree depth is limited to 509 directories and is determined by a maximum
path length of 1,023 characters. However, depths greater than 275 directories may
affect system performance.
- The maximum number of open files is 315,000 per node.
- Hard links are limited to a maximum of 65,535 per cluster. However, setting the
number of per-file hard links to higher than 1,000 can slow down snapshot operations
and file deletions. This per-file value can be configured by the efs.ifm.max_links
syscontrol.
The OneFS protocol daemons, such as the input-output daemon (lwio), may impose
additional constraints on the number of files that a node can have open. The protocol
daemons typically impose such constraints because the kernel places limits on per-
process memory consumption.

OneFS dynamically allocates new inodes from free file system blocks. The maximum
number of possible inodes runs into the billions and depends on the number and density
of nodes in the cluster, as expressed by the following formulas:
- 4Kn drives: ((number of nodes in the cluster) * (node raw TB) * 1000^4 * .99) /
(8192 * (number of inode mirrors))
- 512n drives: ((number of nodes in the cluster) * (node raw TB) * 1000^4 * .73) /
(512 * (number of inode mirrors))

The largest file size that OneFS currently supports is increased to 16 TB in OneFS 8.2.2
and later, up from a maximum of 4 TB in prior releases.
To support files larger than 4 TB, adequate space is required in all of a cluster’s disk pools
in order to avoid a potential performance impact. As such, the following hard requirements
apply:

structure and
layout
File count limits
File size limits

Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
Table 1. Large file support requirements
Large file support
requirement
## Description
Version A cluster must be running OneFS 8.2.2 or later in order to enable large
file support.
## Disk Pool
A maximum sized file (16 TB) plus protection can consume no more
than 10% of any disk pool. This translates to a minimum disk pool
size of 160 TB plus protection.
SyncIQ Policy  All SyncIQ remote clusters must be running OneFS 8.2.2 or later and
also satisfy the restrictions for minimum disk pool size and SyncIQ
policies.

After installing OneFS 8.2.2 or later on a cluster intended for large file support, the
following CLI utility will verify that the cluster’s disk pools and existing SyncIQ policies
meet the above requirements:
# isi_large_file -c
Once the validation confirms that the cluster meets the requirements, the following CLI
command is then run to enable large file support:
# isi_large_file -e

Upon successfully enabling large file support, the ‘cluster full’ alert threshold is
automatically lowered to 85% from the OneFS default of 95%. This is to ensure that
adequate space is available for large file creation, repair, and restriping. Also, any
SyncIQ replication partners must also be running OneFS 8.2.2 or later, adhere to the
above minimum disk pool size, and have the large file feature enabled.
Any disk pool management commands that violate the large file support requirements are
not allowed. Once enabled, disk pools are periodically checked for compliance and
OneFS will alert if a disk pool fails to meet the minimum size requirement.
Be aware that, once enabled, large file support cannot be disabled on a cluster. This may
affect future expansion planning for the cluster and all its SyncIQ replication partners.
For more information about OneFS limits and guidelines, see the PowerScale OneFS
## Technical Specifications Guide.

A typical dataset consists of a mix of large and small files stored in a file system
consisting of a hierarchical directory structure. Usually, around 30 percent of the data is
active; 70 percent is inactive. Snapshots typically back up the data for short-term retention
combined with a long-term DR strategy, which frequently includes replication to a
secondary cluster, and disk-to-disk or disk to tape NDMP backups.
In this document, large files are considered as files that are 128 KB or larger, and small
files are files less than 128 KB. This is significant because at 128 KB and above, OneFS
uses erasure coding (FEC) to parity protect a file, which results in high levels of storage
efficiency. Conversely, files less than 128 KB in size are essentially mirrored, so have a
larger on-disk footprint. Large file efficiency using erasure coding offsets the penalty of
mirroring of small files.

OneFS also provides additional storage efficiency using its native, post-process
deduplication engine, SmartDedupe, as well as in-line compression and deduplication.
More details are provided in OneFS data reduction best practices.
Node hardware recommendations

Another key decision for cluster performance in an environment is the type and quantity of
nodes deployed. Heterogeneous clusters can be architected with a wide variety of node
styles and capacities, in order to meet the needs of a varied dataset and wide spectrum of
workloads. These node styles encompass several hardware generations and fall loosely
into four main categories or tiers.
- Extreme performance (all-flash)
## • Performance
- Hybrid/Utility
## • Archive
The following figure illustrates these tiers, and the associated Gen 6 hardware models:

Figure 1. PowerScale node hardware tiers
Before OneFS 8.0, the recommendation was for a maximum cluster size of around 64
nodes based on numerous factors. These factors include balancing customer experience
with the manageability of extra-large clusters, the risk profile associated with the size of
the fault domain that represents for their business, and the ease and simplicity of a single
cluster. However, OneFS 8 and later releases have seen considerable back-end network
infrastructure enhancements. Those enhancements provide cluster stability up to the
current supported maximum of 252 nodes per cluster in OneFS 8.2 and later.

OneFS SmartPools allows you to define the value of the data within your workflows based
on policies, and automatically aligns data to the appropriate price/performance tier over
time. Data movement is seamless, and with file-level granularity and control using
automated policies, manual control, or API interface, performance and layout, storage tier

alignment, and protection settings can be tuned and optimized with minimal impact to end
users.
OneFS 9.5 introduced SmartPools transfer limits. The transfer limit is a configurable
threshold, expressed as a percentage. If a target pool’s capacity reaches or exceeds the
transfer limit, the pool will be considered full and data will not be moved to that pool.
The principal benefits of transfer limits include reliability, by preventing undesirable
spillover actions, and performance, by avoiding unnecessary work.
Transfer limits can be specified as a percentage per tier or per node pool, or they can be
disabled. The default transfer limit in OneFS 9.5 is 90 percent. The default limit applies to
any of a cluster’s storage pools where a limit is not explicitly set.
OneFS data protection

A OneFS powered cluster eliminates much of the overhead that traditional storage
systems consume. By not having RAID groups, OneFS evenly distributes, or stripes, data
among a cluster's nodes with layout algorithms that maximize storage efficiency and
performance. The system continuously reallocates data across the cluster, further
maximizing space efficiency. At the same time, OneFS protects data with forward error
correction, or FEC—a highly efficient method of reliably protecting data.
- With Gen6 hardware in particular, the best practice is to use the recommended
“hybrid” protection level, typically 2d:1n, for cluster protection.
- The recommended protection level for a particular node pool is indicated as
Suggested in the list of requested protection levels.
You can view the protection levels in the WebUI by going to Data Management >
Storage Pools > SmartPools and selecting the wanted node pool or tier. For example:

Figure 2. OneFS suggested protection level
## Overview

OneFS data protection

10 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
The hybrid protection schemes are particularly useful for PowerScale Gen6 chassis and
other high-density node configurations, where the probability of multiple drives failing far
surpasses that of an entire node failure.
For all current Gen6 hardware configurations, the recommended protection levels are
‘+2d:1n’ or ‘+3d:1n1d’.
In the unlikely event that multiple devices have simultaneously failed, such that the file is
“beyond its protection level,” OneFS will re-protect everything possible and report errors
on the affected individual files to the cluster’s logs.
OneFS also provides various mirroring options ranging from 2x to 8x, allowing from two to
eight mirrors of the specified content. Metadata, for example, is mirrored at one level
above FEC by default. For example, if a file is protected at +2n, its associated metadata
object will be 4x mirrored.
The full range of OneFS protection levels are summarized in the following table:
Table 2. OneFS protection levels
Protection level Description
+1n Tolerate failure of 1 drive OR 1 node (Not Recommended)
+2d:1n Tolerate failure of 2 drives OR 1 node
+2n Tolerate failure of 2 drives OR 2 nodes
+3d:1n Tolerate failure of 3 drives OR 1 node
+3d:1n1d Tolerate failure of 3 drives OR 1 node AND 1 drive
+3n Tolerate failure of 3 drives or 3 nodes
+4d:1n Tolerate failure of 4 drives or 1 node
+4d:2n Tolerate failure of 4 drives or 2 nodes
+4n Tolerate failure of 4 nodes
2x to 8x Mirrored over 2 to 8 nodes, depending on configuration

See the OneFS Technical Overview white paper for further details on OneFS data
protection levels.
OneFS enables the protection policy to be modified in real time, while clients are attached
and reading and writing data. Be aware, however, that increasing a cluster’s protection
level may increase the amount of space consumed by the data on the cluster.
OneFS also provides underprotection alerting for new cluster installations. If the cluster is
underprotected, the cluster event logging system (CELOG) will generate alerts. The alerts
warn the administrator of the protection deficiency and recommend a change to the
appropriate protection level for that cluster’s configuration.



Data tiering and layout recommendations

## 11
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices

In practice, a OneFS powered cluster typically delivers 75 to 90 percent space efficiency
for a typical dataset. Given a dataset with a wide range of file sizes, it is the large files that
dominate utilization, saving as much as 20 to 30 percent of capacity over traditional
storage systems. Even when small files make up more than 90 percent of a dataset by file
count, they consume only 10 percent or less of the capacity. As such, the efficiencies in
storing large files overshadow any inefficiencies in storing small files. Further, as a
dataset increases in size, a cluster moves closer to 80 percent efficiency.
Data tiering and layout recommendations

SmartPools enables a multi-tier architecture to be created using high-performance nodes
with SSD for performance tiers and high-capacity SATA-only nodes for the high-capacity
archive tier. For example, a file pool policy could move files from the performance tier to a
more cost-effective capacity-biased tier after the wanted period of inactivity.

Figure 3. SmartPools tiering
The following figure shows the creation of an ‘archive’ file pool policy for colder data,
which moves files that have not been accessed for more than 30 days to a lower storage
tier.

Data tiering and layout recommendations

12 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices

Figure 4. Creating a file pool policy
For optimal cluster performance, we recommend observing the following OneFS
SmartPools best practices:
- It is not recommended to tier-based on modify time (-mtime). Access time is the
preferred tiering criteria, with an –atime value of 1 day.
- Ensure that cluster capacity utilization (hard drive and SSD) remains below 90% on
each pool.
- If the cluster consists of more than one node type, direct the default file pool policy
to write to the higher performing node pool. Data can then be classified and down-
tiered as necessary.
- A file pool policy can have three ‘OR’ disjunctions and each term joined by an ‘OR’
can contain at most five ‘AND’s.
- The number of file pool policies should not exceed thirty. More than thirty policies
may affect system performance.
- Define a performance and protection profile for each tier and configure it
accordingly.
- File pool policy order precedence matters, as the policies are applied on first match
basis (the first file pool policy to match the expression will be the applied policy).
- When employing a deep archiving strategy, ensure that the performance pool is
optimized for all directories and metadata and the archive tier is just for cold file
storage as they age out. To implement this configuration, add a ‘TYPE=FILE’
statement to the aging file pool policy rule or rules to only move files to the archive
tier.

Data tiering and layout recommendations

## 13
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- By default, the SmartPools job runs only once per day. If you create a file pool
policy to be run at a higher frequency, ensure the SmartPools job is configured to
run multiple times per day.
- Enable SmartPools Virtual Hot Spares with a minimum of 10% space allocation.
This allocation ensures that space is available for data reconstruction and
reprotection in case a drive or node fails. It also generally helps guard against file-
system-full issues.
- Avoid creating hard links to files which will cause the file to match different file pool
policies
- If node pools are combined into tiers, the file pool rules should target the tiers rather
than specific node pools within the tiers.
- Avoid creating tiers that combine node pools both with and without SSDs.
- The number of SmartPools tiers should not exceed five. Although you can exceed
the guideline of five tiers, doing so is not recommended because it might affect
system performance.
- Where possible, ensure that all nodes in a cluster have at least one SSD, including
nearline and high-density nodes.
- For performance workloads, SSD metadata read-write acceleration is
recommended. The metadata read acceleration helps with getattr, access, and
lookup operations while the write acceleration helps reduce latencies on create,
delete, setattr, mkdir operations. Ensure that sufficient SSD capacity (6-10%) is
available before turning on metadata-write acceleration.
- Determine if metadata operations for a particular workload are biased towards
reads, writes, or an even mix, and select the optimal SmartPools metadata strategy.
- Avoid using OneFS Filesystem Explorer or the ‘isi set’ command to change file
attributes, such as protection level, for a group of data. Instead use SmartPools file
pool policies.
- If SmartPools takes more than a day to run on OneFS 8.2 or later, or the cluster is
already running the FSAnalyze job, consider scheduling the FilePolicy (and
corresponding IndexUpdate job) to run daily. Also consider reducing the frequency
of the SmartPools job to monthly. The following table provides a suggested job
schedule when deploying FilePolicy:
Table 3. Suggested job schedule when deploying FilePolicy
## Job Schedule Impact Priority
FilePolicy Every day at 22:00 LOW 6
IndexUpdate Every six hours, every day LOW 5
SmartPools Monthly – Sunday at 23:00 LOW 6

- If planning on using atime, be sure to enable Access Time Tracking as early as
possible. The use of a 24-hour precision is recommended to prevent performance
problems.

white paper.

Data access settings can be configured at the pool (or even the single file) level to
optimize data access for the type of application accessing it. Data can be optimized for
concurrent, streaming, or random access. Each of these settings changes how data is laid
out on disk and how it is cached.

As the settings indicate, the ‘Random’ access setting performs little to no read-cache
prefetching to avoid wasted disk access. This works best for workload with only small files
(< 128 KB) and large files with random small block accesses.
Streaming access works best for sequentially read medium to large files. This access
pattern uses aggressive prefetching to improve overall read throughput, and on disk
layout spreads the file across many disks to optimize access.

Files that are added to the directory are governed by these settings, most of which
can be changed by applying a file pool policy to the directory.

In addition to traditional hard disk drives (HDDs), OneFS nodes can also contain a smaller
quantity of flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs), right up to all-flash nodes.
There are several ways that SSDs can be used within a cluster.
SSD strategies

Data tiering and layout recommendations

## 17
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
OneFS SSD Strategies are configured on a per file pool basis. These strategies include:
- Metadata read acceleration: Creates a preferred mirror of file metadata on SSD and
writes the rest of the metadata, plus all the actual file data, to HDDs.
- Metadata read and write acceleration: Creates all the mirrors of a file’s metadata on
SSD. Actual file data goes to HDDs.
- Avoid SSDs: Never uses SSDs; writes all associated file data and metadata to
HDDs only. This strategy is used when there is insufficient SSD storage and you
want to prioritize its utilization.
- Data on SSDs: All of a node pool’s data and metadata resides on SSD.
Any node pools consisting of off all-flash F-series nodes will automatically store all data
and metadata on SSD, since those nodes do not contain any traditional hard disk drives.
The following SSD strategy decision tree explains the options available:

Data tiering and layout recommendations

18 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices

Figure 7. SSD usage decision tree
In all these cases, ensure that SSD capacity utilization remains below 90%.
If snapshots are enabled on a cluster, use the SSD Strategy “Use SSDs for metadata
read/write acceleration” to enable faster snapshots deletes. The SSD metadata write
strategy will require 6-10% of a pool’s capacity on SSD to accommodate all the metadata
mirrors.
In order to configure a particular tier to be the default for both data and metadata, the
default file pool policy requires the SSD strategy to be set to Use SSDs for data &
metadata.
For more information about data tiering and management in OneFS, see the SmartPools
white paper.

Data tiering and layout recommendations

## 19
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices

OneFS uses up to three levels of read cache, plus an NVRAM-backed write cache, or
coalescer, as shown in the following figure.

Figure 8. OneFS caching hierarchy
The first two types of read cache, level 1 (L1) and level 2 (L2), are memory (RAM) based,
and analogous to the cache used in processors (CPUs). These two cache layers are
present in all storage nodes.
An optional third tier of read cache, called SmartFlash or Level 3 cache (L3), is also
configurable on nodes that contain solid state drives (SSDs). SmartFlash (L3 cache) is an
eviction cache that is populated by L2 cache blocks as they are aged out from memory.

If you are using L3 cache, we recommend the following best practices:
- Use a small number (ideally no more than two) of large capacity SSDs rather than
multiple small SSDs.
- Use the appropriate capacity of SSDs that will fit your working dataset. The
isi_cache_stats utility can help to determine that on existing clusters. A useful
general rule is to size L3 SSD capacity per node according to the following formula:
L2 capacity + L3 capacity >= 150% of working set size.
- While L3 cache can potentially use up to a 2:1 hard drive to SSD ratio per node,
use at most 2-3 SSDs for L3 per node.

L3 cache best
practices

Data tiering and layout recommendations

20 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- Repeated random read workloads will typically benefit most from L3 cache through
latency improvements.
- Although not recommended, both L3 cache and Global Namespace Acceleration
(GNA) are supported within the same cluster.
- The same procedure is used for replacing failed L3 cache SSDs as for other
storage drives. However, L3 cache SSDs do not require FlexProtect or
AutoBalance to run post replacement, so it is typically a much faster process.
- For a legacy node pool using a SmartPools metadata-write strategy, do not convert
to L3 cache unless:
▪ The SSDs are seriously underutilized.
▪ The SSDs in the pool are oversubscribed and spilling over to hard disk.
▪ Your primary concern is SSD longevity.
L3 cache considerations
When deploying L3 cache, the following considerations should be kept in mind:
- All the SSDs within a node pool can either be used for L3 cache, or for SmartPools
data strategies (metadata-ro, metadata-rw, data) – but not mixed L3/SmartPools
usage.
- L3 cache is not applicable for nodes containing 16 or more SSDs, and all SSD
node pools are not eligible for L3 cache enablement.
- Enabling L3 cache on an existing node pool with SSDs takes some time. The data
and metadata on the SSDs have to be evacuated to other drives before the SSDs
can be formatted for caching. Conversely, disabling L3 cache is a very fast
operation because no data has to be moved and drive reformatting can begin right
away.
- If you are concerned about metadata being evicted from L3, you can deploy more
SSDs per node to accommodate a large working set. Alternatively, you can disable
L3 and stick with traditional SmartPools metadata acceleration (either metadata
read-only or read/write) for the particular node pool.
- It is possible to have GNA and L3 in the same cluster (different node pools),
although some manual setup is required including a SmartPools policy to avoid
SSD storage on L3 node pool.  Note that L3 node pool hard drive space does count
towards GNA limits
- All the SSDs in an L3 cache node pool must be the same size.
- If an L3 cache SSD fails, OneFS does not need to run FlexProtect or AutoBalance
jobs, like with a regular file system SSD. However, after the failed SSD is replaced,
some time will be needed before the cache is repopulated.
- All new node pools containing SSD will have L3 cache enabled by default.
- Existing node pools with SSD will not be modified to use L3 cache on upgrade.
- SSDs displace HDDs. More SSDs and fewer hard drive spindles can impact
streaming and concurrency performance towards total capacity.

Network recommendations

## 21
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- The L3 cache is intentionally avoided for streaming reads during data prefetch
operation. The streaming requests are kept to the spinning disks (HDDs), while the
SSDs are used for the random I/O.
- L3 cache node pool hard drive space does not count in GNA SSD percentage
calculations.
- In L3 cache, metadata is preferentially cached over data blocks.
- When a node reboots, there is no automatic flushing of L2 blocks to L3 cache.
- Unlike HDDs and SSDs that are used for storage, when an SSD used for L3 cache
fails, the drive state should immediately change to REPLACE without a FlexProtect
job running. An SSD used for L3 cache contains only cache data that does not
have to be protected by FlexProtect. After the drive state changes to REPLACE,
you can pull and replace the failed SSD.
- Although there is no percentage completion reporting shown when converting node
pools to use L3 cache, you can estimate it by tracking SSD space usage
throughout the job run. The Job impact policy of the FlexprotectPlus or SmartPools
job, responsible for the L3 conversion, can also be reprioritized to run faster or
slower.
- InsightIQ reports current and historical L3 cache statistics.
- For L3 cache, the isi_cache_stats prefetch statistics will always read zero because
it is purely an eviction cache and does not use data or metadata prefetch.
- L3 cache has a metadata only mode (as opposed to data and metadata) to support
high-density archive storage nodes.

Network recommendations

There are two separate network infrastructures associated with a Dell PowerScale cluster.

Clients connect to the cluster using Ethernet connections (10, 25, 40 or 100 GbE) that are
available on all nodes. . Plus OneFS 9.10 introduces support for InfiniBand front-end
connectivity on the all-flash F910 and F710 platforms. Because each node provides its
own network interfaces, the amount of aggregate bandwidth available to the cluster scales
linearly with performance and capacity. The cluster supports standard network
communication protocols to a customer network, including NFS, SMB, HTTP, FTP, HDFS,
and S3 object, plus full IPv4 and IPv6 support.
Note: Full IPv6 support is available in OneFS 9.8 and later releases, with the addition of IPv6-
aware Source-based routing (SBR).
## Introduction
External front-
end network

Network recommendations

22 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices

Figure 9. Cluster networking architectural overview

For most workflows, the recommendation is to configure at least one front-end 25, 40, or
100 GbE connection per node to support the high levels of network utilization that take
place. Archive nodes and cold data workloads can sometimes be fine with 10 Gb Ethernet
connections per node.
A best practice is to bind multiple IP addresses to each node interface in a SmartConnect
subnet pool. Generally, optimal balancing and failover are achieved when the number of
addresses allocated to the subnet pool equals N * (N – 1), where N equals the number of
node interfaces in the pool. For example, if a pool is configured with a total of five node
interfaces, the optimal IP address allocation would total 20 IP addresses (5 * (5 – 1) = 20)
to allocate four IP addresses to each node interface in the pool. For larger-scaled clusters,
there is a practical number of IP addresses that is a good compromise between N * (N -1)
approach and a single IP per node approach. Example: for a 35-node cluster, 34 IPs per
node may not be necessary, depending on workflow.
Assigning each workload or data store to a unique IP address enables OneFS
SmartConnect to move each workload to one of the other interfaces. This minimizes the
additional work that a remaining node in the SmartConnect pool must absorb and
ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed across all the other nodes in the pool.
For a SmartConnect pool with four-node interfaces, using the N * (N – 1) model will result
in three unique IP addresses being allocated to each node. A failure on one node
interface will cause each of that interface’s three IP addresses to fail over to a different
node in the pool. This ensuring that each of the three active interfaces remaining in the
pool receives one IP address from the failed node interface. If client connections to that
node were evenly balanced across its three IP addresses, SmartConnect distributes the
workloads to the remaining pool members evenly.
For more information, see the Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations white
paper.

where the MTU is set to 1500 bytes. For example, jumbo frames can provide about 5
percent better throughput and about 1 percent less CPU usage.
For more information, see the Dell PowerScale: Network Design Considerations white
paper.
Network isolation
OneFS optimizes storage performance by designating zones to support specific
workloads or subsets of clients. Different network traffic types can be isolated on separate
subnets using SmartConnect pools.
For large clusters, partitioning the cluster’s networking resources and allocating bandwidth
to each workload minimizes the likelihood that heavy traffic from one workload will affect
network throughput for another. SyncIQ replication and NDMP backup traffic, in particular,
can benefit from its own set of interfaces, separate from user and client I/O load.
Many customers as a best practice create separate SmartConnect subnets for the
following traffic isolation:
- Workflow separation.
- SyncIQ Replication.
- NDMP backup on target cluster.
- Service Subnet for cluster administration and management traffic.
- Different node types and performance profiles.
OneFS includes a ‘Groupnets’ networking object as part of the support for multitenancy.
Groupnets sit above subnets and pools and allow separate Multi-tenant Access Zones to
contain distinct DNS settings.

Figure 10. OneFS network object hierarchy
Connection-balancing and failover policies
By default, OneFS SmartConnect balances connections among nodes by using a round-
robin policy and a separate IP pool for each subnet. A SmartConnect license adds
advanced balancing policies to evenly distribute CPU usage, client connections, or
throughput. It also lets you define IP address pools to support multiple DNS zones in a
subnet.

-  Metrics are gathered every 5 seconds for CPU utilization and every 10 seconds for Connection
Count and Network Throughput. In cases where many connections are created at the same time,
these metrics may not be accurate, creating an imbalance across nodes.
A ‘round robin’ load balancing strategy is the recommendation for both client connection
balancing and IP failover.
Dynamic failover
SmartConnect supports IP failover to provide continuous access to data when hardware or
a network path fails. Dynamic failover is recommended for high availability workloads on
SmartConnect subnets that handle traffic from NFS clients.
For optimal network performance, observe the following SmartConnect best practices:
- Do not mix interface types (40 Gb, 10 Gb, 1 Gb) in the same SmartConnect Pool
- Do not mix node types with different performance profiles (for example, H700 and
A300 interfaces).
- Use the ‘round-robin’ SmartConnect Client Connection Balancing and IP-failover
policies.
SmartConnect pool sizing
To evenly distribute connections and optimize performance, the recommendation is to size
SmartConnect for the expected number of connections and for the anticipated overall
throughput likely to be generated. The sizing factors for a pool include:
- The total number of active client connections expected to use the pool’s bandwidth at
any time.
- Expected aggregate throughput that the pool needs to deliver.
- The minimum performance and throughput requirements in case an interface fails.
Because OneFS is a single volume, fully distributed file system, a client can access all the
files and associated metadata that are stored on the cluster, regardless of the type of node
a client connects to or the node pool on which the data resides. For example, data stored
for performance reasons on a pool of all-flash nodes can be mounted and accessed by
connecting to an archive node in the same cluster. The different types of platform nodes,
however, deliver different levels of performance.
To avoid unnecessary network latency under most circumstances, the recommendation is
to configure SmartConnect subnets such that client connections are to the same physical
pool of nodes on which the data resides. In other words, if a workload’s data lives on a

Protocol recommendations

## 25
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
pool of F-series nodes for performance reasons, the clients that work with that data should
mount the cluster through a pool that includes the same F-series nodes that host the data.

Keep in mind the following networking and name server considerations:
- Minimize disruption by suspending nodes in preparation for planned maintenance
and resuming them after maintenance is complete
- Leverage the groupnet feature to enhance multitenancy and DNS delegation,
where desirable.
- Ensure traffic flows through the right interface by tracing routes. Leverage OneFS
Source-Based Routing (SBR) feature to keep traffic on wanted paths.
- If you have firewalls, ensure that the appropriate ports are open. For example, for
the DNS service, if you open UDP port 53, ensure that TCP port 53 is also open.
- The client never sends a DNS request directly to the cluster. Instead, the site
nameservers handle DNS requests from clients and route the requests
appropriately.
- In order to successfully distribute IP addresses, the OneFS SmartConnect DNS
delegation server answers DNS queries with a time-to-live (TTL) of 0 so that the
answer is not cached. Certain DNS servers (particularly Windows DNS Servers) will
fix the value to one second. If many clients request an address within the same
second, all of them receive the same address. If you encounter this problem, you
might have to use a different DNS server, such as BIND.
- Certain clients perform DNS caching and might not connect to the node with the
lowest load if they make multiple connections within the lifetime of the cached
address.
- The site DNS servers must be able to communicate with the node that is currently
hosting the SmartConnect service. That node is the node with the lowest logical
node number (LNN) with an active interface in the subnet that contains the SSIP
address. This behavior cannot be modified.
- Connection policies other than round robin are sampled every 10 seconds. The
CPU policy is sampled every 5 seconds. If multiple requests are received during the
same sampling interval, SmartConnect will attempt to balance these connections by
estimating or measuring the additional load.
For more information, see the OneFS SmartConnect white paper.
Protocol recommendations

NFSv3 is the ubiquitous protocol for clients accessing storage due to the maturity of the
protocol version, ease of implementation, and wide availability of client and server stacks.
There are some useful configuration settings to keep in mind when using a OneFS
powered cluster with NFS clients in a performance-oriented environment.
SmartConnect
considerations
## NFS
considerations

Protocol recommendations

26 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
Client NFS mount settings
For NFS3 and NFS4, the maximum read and write sizes (rsize and wsize) are 1 MB.
When you mount NFS exports from a cluster, a larger read and write size for remote
procedure calls can improve throughput. The default read size in OneFS is 128 KB. An
NFS client uses the largest supported size by default. Setting the value too small on a
client overrides the default value and can undermine performance.
For performance workloads, the recommendation is to avoid explicitly setting NFS rsize or
wsize parameters on NFS clients when mounting a cluster’s NFS exports directly, or using
the automounter. Instead, for NFSv3 clients, use the following mount parameters:
mount -vers=3,rw,tcp,hard,intr,retry=2,retrans=5,timeo=600
For NFS clients that support it, the READDIRPLUS call can improve performance by
‘prefetching’ file handle, attribute information, and directory entries, plus information to
allow the client to request additional directory entries in a subsequent readdirplus
transaction. This ability relieves the client from having to query the server for that
information separately for each entry.
For an environment with a high file count, the readdirplus prefetch can be configured to a
value higher than the default value of 10. For a low file count environment, you can
experiment with setting it lower than the default.
Another recommendation for performance NFS workflows is to use asynchronous (async)
mounts from the client. Conversely, using sync as a client mount option makes all write
operations synchronous, usually resulting in poor write performance. Sync mounts should
be used only when a client program relies on synchronous writes without specifying them.
Optimal thread count
The number of threads used by the OneFS NFS server is dynamically allocated and auto-
tuned, and is dependent on the amount of available RAM.
NFS connection count
As a conservative best practice, active NFS v3 or v4 connections should be kept under
1,000, where possible. Although no maximum limit for NFS connections has been
established, the number of available TCP sockets can limit the number of NFS
connections. The number of connections that a node can process depends on the ratio of
active-to-idle connections as well as the resources available to process the sessions.
Monitoring the number of NFS connections to each node helps prevent overloading a
node with connections.
NFS recommendations
The recommended limit for NFS exports per cluster is 40,000. To maximize performance,
configure NFS exports for asynchronous commit.
For larger NFS environments consider the following:
- Use 100, 40, or 25 GbE whenever available.
- Consider aggregating client interfaces using LACP (unless using NFS nconect).
- Where possible, use Jumbo frames (MTU 9000) to increase network payload.

Protocol recommendations

## 27
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- Use SmartConnect load-balancing, typically with a round-robin balancing policy.
- Optimize mount point organization.
- Consider using NFS netgroups for large, complex NFS environments.
- For high-throughput workloads, OneFS 9.10 supports 200Gb Ethernet or Infiniband
front-end networks on both the F910 and F710 platforms.
NFS over RDMA
OneFS 9.2 and later versions include Remote Direct Memory Access support for
applications and clients with NFS over RDMA. OneFS 9.2 and later versions allow
substantially higher throughput performance, especially for single connection and read-
intensive workloads, while also reducing both cluster and client CPU utilization. OneFS
9.2 and later versions support NFSv3 over RDMA by the ROCEv2 network protocol (also
known as Routable RoCE or RRoCE). New OneFS CLI and WebUI configuration options
have been added, including global enablement, and IP pool configuration, filtering and
verification of RoCEv2 capable network interfaces.
NFS over RDMA is also available on all PowerScale nodes that contain Mellanox
ConnectX network adapters on the front end with either 25, 40, or 100 GbE connectivity.
The ‘isi network interfaces list’ CLI command can be used to easily identify which of a
cluster’s NICs support RDMA.
On the other side, the NFS clients will also need RoCEv2 capable NICs and drivers, and
to be running RoCEv2.
Key considerations when using NFS over RDMA include:
- The MTU should match on both the OneFS cluster and NFSv3 client.
- IP failover will not work from an interface that supports ROCEv2 to one that does
not. Therefore, if you are testing on a cluster where not all NICs support RoCE, and
you are configuring failover, you are advised to create a separate RDMA IP pool.
- It is also recommended to place a router, or L3 Switch, between the OneFS cluster
nodes and the RDMA clients, since the Linux NFS over RDMA stack tends not to
handle Gratuitous ARP very gracefully.
- Priority flow control should be enabled on all the switch ports.
For more information, see the OneFS NFS Design Considerations and Best Practices
white paper.

Server Message Block (SMB), also known as Common Internet File System, is Microsoft’s
application-layer network protocol for Windows file sharing. While SMB1 is rarely used
these days, OneFS also supports SMB2 and SMB3, including features such as
continuous availability (CA) for transparent failover, encryption, and multichannel for
increased application throughput.
Best practices for the SMB protocol on OneFS include:
- The recommendation is to use either SMB2 or SMB3 Windows clients. Where
possible, avoid using SMB1.
## SMB
considerations

Protocol recommendations

28 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- Create no more than 80,000 SMB shares per cluster and keep share names below
80 characters.
- For SMB 2 & 3, do not exceed 3,000 active sessions and 27,000 idle connections
per node. For SMB1, the recommended limit is 1000 connections per node.
- SMB read and write performance improvements can often be achieved by setting
the data-access pattern to Streaming.
- A multi-tenant access zone can authenticate users with only one Active Directory
domain. Although you can add more than one of the other directory services to a
zone, a best practice is to limit each zone to no more than one of each of the
directory services. User mapping rules apply only in the multi-tenant access zone in
which you created them.
- As a best practice, if you create multi-tenant access zones, make sure that the
directory paths for each zone under /ifs do not overlap. Instead, you should
designate separate directory trees for each zone.
- In general, a best practice is to use Microsoft Active Directory with Windows
Services for UNIX and RFC 2307 attributes to manage Linux, UNIX, and Windows
systems. In some versions of Microsoft Windows, Windows Services for UNIX is
also known as Identity Management for UNIX (IDMU). Integrating UNIX and Linux
systems with Active Directory centralizes identity management and eases
interoperability. Make sure your domain controllers are running Windows Server
2003 R2 or later.
- Where possible, a best practice is to authenticate all users with Kerberos because it
is a highly secure protocol. If you are authenticating users with Kerberos, ensure
that both the cluster and clients use either Active Directory or the same NTP server
as their time source.
- In an environment with two or more identity management systems, the simplest
configurations name users consistently so that each UNIX user corresponds to a
similarly named Windows user. Before assigning a UID and GID, OneFS searches
its other authentication providers, such as LDAP, for other identities with the same
name. If OneFS finds a match, the mapping service by default selects the
associated UID and group memberships. Naming users consistently also allows
user mapping rules with wildcards to match names and map them without explicitly
specifying each pair of accounts.
- The native identity option is likely to be the best for a network with UNIX and
Windows systems. In native mode, OneFS favors setting the UID as the on-disk
identity because doing so improves NFS performance. OneFS stores only one type
of identifier—either a UID and a GID or a SID—on disk at a time. As a best practice,
if you change the on-disk identity, you should run the repair permissions job; see
the OneFS Administration Guide.

SMB3 Multichannel allows storage devices to use multiple network connections
simultaneously and dramatically increase throughput to clients and is enabled by default
on OneFS. The SMB client will automatically detect, negotiate, and use multiple network
connections if a proper configuration is identified.
## SMB3
## Multichannel

Protocol recommendations

## 29
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
On the client side, use Windows 2012 or Windows 8 or later, with at least one of the
following 10, 25, 40, or 100 Gb Ethernet network configurations:
- Multiple network adapters
- One or more network adapters that support RSS (Receive Side Scaling)
- One of more network adapters configured with NIC Teaming
## Additionally:
- Use a high-performance nonblocking Ethernet switch.
- Avoid configuring LACP.
- If using SMB multichannel, it will automatically detect the IP addresses of both
10GbE/40GbE interfaces on the client and load balance across each of the two
interfaces on the dual-ported NIC.
- SMB multichannel only works between a client and a single PowerScale node. It
cannot share the load between PowerScale nodes. With SMB multichannel,
Windows client connections to PowerScale node have integrated failover, and all
throughput is load-balanced between NICs.
- No manual configuration is required on either the Windows client or PowerScale
cluster to enable SMB multichannel.
- Each cluster interface is given its own static IP address in the same subnet – do not
bond the Ethernet connections using LACP.
- Configure the client’s NIC driver as follows:
▪  “Max Number of RSS Queues” set to the physical core count for client’s CPU
▪ “Receive Side Scaling” set to “Enabled”
▪ “Receive Buffers” set to 4096
▪ “Transmit Buffers” set to 16384
- If using Windows Server 2012, make sure the “Enable Virtual Machine Queues”
setting under “Virtualization” is set to disabled.
- Windows 8 clients may need the “interrupt moderation rate” in the NIC driver set to
“disabled” in order to achieve optimal performance.
- SMB continuous availability can only be enabled during share creation. However,
users can still update timeout, lockout, and write integrity settings when creating or
modifying a share.
- SMB continuous availability is not enabled by default. An existing share needs to be
re-created in order to enable CA.
For more information, see the Dell PowerScale: Solution Design and Considerations for
SMB Environments white paper.


New cluster best practices

30 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
New cluster best practices
When initializing a new cluster, the OneFS installation process creates three directories
under the clustered file system root, /ifs:
## • /ifs/data
## • /ifs/home
## • /ifs/.ifsvar
Consider the following guidelines for directories under /ifs.
- Avoid modifying permissions on /ifs/.ifsvar (mode 755). Do not use directory for
general storage.
- Avoid modifying /ifs/data/Isilon_Support, which is created the first time the
isi_gather_info command is run to collect cluster logs.
- Create hidden shares for /ifs and set ACLs appropriately.
In OneFS 9.0 and later, /ifs/.ifsvar is hidden from view in the CLI, utilities, scripts,
protocols, and recursive tools. Anything that attempts to access .ifsvar by full or relative
path will still succeed. This feature works by omitting /ifs/.ifsvar when listing this one
directory. It only effects the ./ifsvar directory and does not prevent protocols from
accessing /ifs/.ifsvar. Prior to OneFS 9.0, /ifs/.ifsvar is hidden from view, but not from
tools, scripts, or protocols.
Proper directory layout is critical to a successful OneFS disaster recovery plan.
When planning a cluster’s initial directory structure, consider multitenancy, availability,
and disaster recovery requirements.
- During a failover event, NFS clients require their exported paths to remain the same
to enable accessing the data. The mount entry for any NFS connection must have a
consistent mount point so that during failover, you do not have to manually edit the
file system table (fstab) or automount entries on all connected clients.
- OneFS balances a cluster’s connections among all the nodes that service external
(front-end) connections. Regularly monitor cluster connections (for example, with
InsightIQ). If the number of connections frequently approaches the maximum
number the node can support, consider adding another node.
- SmartConnect balances incoming network connections across all the configured
network interfaces in a SmartConnect Zone or pool with one of several load-
balancing policies. The most common of these policies is round robin, which is
effective for most workflows. However, understand whether your front-end
connections are being evenly distributed, either in count or bandwidth. Monitor
front-end connection distribution.
- Regularly monitor cluster usage with InsightIQ, the OneFS WebUI dashboard, or
the command-line interface (CLI). When disk space usage reaches 90 percent, Dell
strongly recommends adding additional capacity.
- Many cluster configuration settings are global and have cluster-wide effects. Before
changing cluster-wide configuration settings, ensure that you fully understand the

Data availability and protection recommendations

## 31
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
global settings and their implications. For information about global cluster
configuration settings, see the OneFS Administration Guide
- Confirm that remote support functions work correctly through Secure Remote
Services or internal email/SNMP notifications. Note that OneFS 9.1 and beyond
only support ESRSv3. Clusters running ESRSv2 will be automatically transitioned
to v3 on upgrade to OneFS 9.1 or later.
- OneFS 9.5 and later provides integration with Dell Technologies Connectivity
Services (formerly known as SupportAssist), the next-generation remote
connectivity system for transmitting events, logs, and telemetry from a PowerScale
cluster to Dell Support. Connectivity Services provides a full replacement for ESRS,
as well as enabling Dell Support to perform remote diagnosis and remediation of
cluster issues. Intended for all customers who can send telemetry off-cluster to Dell
over the Internet, Connectivity Services integrates ESE into PowerScale OneFS,
along with a suite of daemons to allow its use on a distributed system.
- OneFS provides a recommended protection level based on cluster configuration.
This suggested protection level strikes the best balance between data protection
and storage efficiency. Follow its recommendations.
- Recommend disabling client DNS caching, where possible. To handle client
requests properly, SmartConnect requires that clients use the latest DNS entries. If
clients cache SmartConnect DNS information, they might connect to incorrect
SmartConnect zone names. In this situation, SmartConnect might not appear to be
functioning properly.
- Use LACP on interfaces that carry clients when LACP can be configured across two
separate switches to provide switch redundancy.
- Use consistent Ethernet MTU sizes across your network. For example, if using
jumbo frames, ensure MTU 9000 is enabled uniformly across the network
infrastructure to prevent packet fragmentation or dropped data.
- If round-robin is used as the SmartConnect load balancing strategy with only a
small number of high-throughput clients (fewer than 10), the distribution of
SMB/NFS connections could result in overloading a few nodes while starving
others.
Data availability and protection recommendations

A solid business continuity plan is at the core of every effective data protection strategy.
An explicitly defined and routinely tested plan is essential to minimize the potential impact
to the workflow when a failure or natural disaster occurs
Among the primary approaches to data protection are fault tolerance, redundancy,
snapshots, replication (local and/or geographically separate), and backups to nearline
storage, VTL, or tape.
Availability and
recovery
objectives

Data availability and protection recommendations

32 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
Some of these methods are biased towards cost efficiency but have a higher risk
associated with them, and others represent a higher cost but also offer an increased level
of protection. Two ways to measure cost against risk from a data protection point of view
are:
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): RTO is the allotted amount of time within a
Service Level Agreement (SLA) to recover data. For example, an RTO of four hours
means data must be restored and made available within four hours of an outage.
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): RPO is the acceptable amount of data loss that
can be tolerated per an SLA. With an RPO of 30 minutes, 30 minutes is the
maximum amount of time that can elapse since the last backup or snapshot was
taken.
The availability and protection of data can be illustrated in terms of a continuum:

Figure 11. OneFS data protection technology alignment with protection continuum
At the beginning of the continuum sits high availability. This requirement is usually
satisfied by redundancy and fault tolerant designs. The goal here is continuous availability
and the avoidance of downtime by the use of redundant components and services.
Further along the continuum are the data recovery approaches in order of decreasing
timeliness: SnapshotIQ for fast recovery, followed by SyncIQ, and finally traditional
backup, providing insurance against large-scale data loss, natural disasters, and other
catastrophic events.
- Snapshots are frequently used to back up the data for short-term retention and to
satisfy low recovery objective SLAs.
- Replication of data from the primary cluster to a target DR cluster, ideally at a
geographically separate location, is strongly recommended.
- NDMP backup to tape or VTL (virtual tape library) typically satisfies longer term
high recovery objective SLAs and any regulatory compliance requirements.
For more information, see the High Availability and Data Protection with Dell PowerScale
Scale-out NAS white paper.

Data availability and protection recommendations

## 33
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices

Snapshots always carry a trade-off between cluster resource consumption (CPU,
memory, disk) and the benefit of increased data availability, protection, and recovery.

Figure 12. SnapshotIQ integration with NDMP backups
OneFS SnapshotIQ creates snapshots at the directory-level instead of the volume-level,
thereby providing improved granularity.
There is no requirement for reserved space for snapshots in OneFS. Snapshots can use
as much or little of the available file system space as desirable.
Snapshots can either be manually taken on-demand or automated with a snapshot
schedule.
Snapshot scheduling allows cluster administrators to automatically generate snapshots
according to a predefined itinerary. OneFS snapshot schedules can be configured at
daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly intervals, with single or multiple job frequency per
schedule, and down to a per-minute granularity. Similarly, automatic snapshot deletion
can be configured per defined schedule at an hourly through yearly range.
- An ordered deletion schedule is simple to configure but retains a larger number of
snapshots and is recommended for datasets with a lower rate of change.
- For more active data, an unordered deletion schedule can prove more effective.
The configuration and monitoring overhead is slightly higher, but fewer snapshots
are retained.
The following table provides a suggested snapshot schedule for both ordered and
unordered deletion configurations.

For optimal cluster performance, we recommend observing the following SnapshotIQ best
practices.
- Use an ordered snapshot deletion strategy where viable.
- Configure the cluster to take fewer snapshots, and for the snapshots to expire more
quickly, so that less space will be consumed by old snapshots. Take only as many
snapshots as you need and keep them active for only as long as you need them.
- Using SmartPools, snapshots can physically reside on a different disk tier than the
original data. The recommendation, however, is to keep snapshots on the same tier
on which they were taken.
- The default snapshot limit is 20,000 per cluster. We recommend limiting snapshot
creation to 1,024 per directory.
- Limit snapshot depth to a maximum of 275 directories.
- Avoid creating snapshots of directories that are already referenced by other
snapshots.
- It is recommended that you do not create more than 1000 hard links per file in a
snapshot to avoid performance degradation.
- Creating snapshots of directories higher on a directory tree will increase the amount
of time it takes to modify the data referenced by the snapshot and require more
cluster resources to manage the snapshot and the directory.
- Avoid taking snapshots at /ifs level. Taking snapshots at a parent dataset level is
recommended, enabling faster snapshot deletions and avoiding management
complexities. In particular, avoid taking nested snapshots, redundant snapshots, or
overly scoped snapshots. For example, if you schedule snapshots of /ifs/data and
/ifs/data/foo and/ifs/data/foo/bar, consider taking snapshots of only the intermediate
or most granularly scoped part (/ifs/data/foo or /ifs/data/foo/bar).
- If you intend on reverting snapshots for a directory, it is recommended that you
create SnapRevert domains for those directories while the directories are empty.
Creating a domain for a directory that contains less data takes less time.

Data availability and protection recommendations

## 35
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- Delete snapshots in order, beginning with the oldest. Where possible, avoid
deleting snapshots from the middle of a time range. Newer snapshots are mostly
pointers to older snapshots and deleting them will not free up much space. Deleting
the oldest snapshot ensures you will actually free up the space. You can determine
snapshot order (if not by name or date) by using the isi snapshots list command.
The snapshot IDs (first column) are non-conserved, serial values.
- Configure the SSD Strategy to “Use SSDs for metadata read/write acceleration” for
faster snapshots deletes.
- Quotas can be used to calculate a file and directory count that includes snapshot
revisions, provided the quota is configured to include snaps in its accounting
using the “--snaps=true” configuration option.
- SnapshotDelete will only run if the cluster is in a fully available state, (no drives or
nodes are down).
- A snapshot schedule cannot span multiple days: To generate snapshots from 5:00
PM Monday to 5:00 AM Tuesday, create one schedule that generates snapshots
from 5:00 PM to 11:59 PM on Monday, and another schedule that generates
snapshots from 12:00 AM to 5:00 AM on Tuesday.
- If a directory is moved, you cannot revert any snapshots of that directory that were
taken before its move.
- Do not delete SyncIQ snapshots (snapshots with names that start with SIQ), unless
the only remaining snapshots on the cluster are SyncIQ snapshots, and the only
way to free up space is to delete those SyncIQ snapshots.
Writable snapshots, first available in OneFS 9.3, provide the ability to create fast, simple,
lightweight copies of datasets. They provide a modifiable view of a regular snapshot,
presented at a target directory and accessible by clients across the full range of supported
NAS protocols. This allows disaster recovery procedures to be routinely tested on
identical, space-efficient, temporary copies of production data.
For more information, see the Data Protection with Dell PowerScale SnapshotIQ white
paper.

OneFS SyncIQ delivers high-performance, asynchronous replication of unstructured data
to address a broad range of recovery point objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives
(RTO). This enables customers to make an optimal tradeoff between infrastructure cost
and potential for data loss if a disaster occurs. SyncIQ does not impose a hard limit on the
size of a replicated file system so will scale linearly with an organization’s data growth up
into the multiple petabyte ranges.
SyncIQ is easily optimized for either LAN or WAN connectivity to replicate over short or
long distances, providing protection from both site-specific and regional disasters.
Additionally, SyncIQ uses a highly parallel, policy-based replication architecture designed
to leverage the performance and efficiency of clustered storage. As such, aggregate
throughput scales with capacity and allows a consistent RPO over expanding datasets.
A secondary cluster synchronized with the primary production cluster can afford a
substantially improved RTO and RPO than tape backup. Both implementations have their
di tinct advantages. And SyncIQ performance is easily tuned to optimize either for network

bandwidth efficiency across a WAN or for LAN speed synchronization. Synchronization
policies may be configured at the file level, directory level, or entire file-system-level and
can either be scheduled to run at regular intervals or performed manually.

Figure 13. SyncIQ change-based replication
OneFS queues any additional jobs until a job execution slot becomes available, and jobs
that are queued can be easily canceled. SyncIQ policies also have a priority setting to
allow favored policies to preempt others. In addition to chronological scheduling,
replication policies can also be configured to start whenever the source is modified
(change based replication). If preferred, a delay period can be added to defer the start of
a change-based policy.
Bear in mind the following SyncIQ recommendations:
- Highly recommend implementing Superna Eyeglass for failover/failback.
- The recommended limit of running SyncIQ policies is 1000 policies and 50
concurrent jobs per cluster (for a cluster with 4 or more nodes).
- While the maximum number of workers per node per policy is eight, the default and
recommended number of workers per node is three.
- The recommended limit of workers per replication policy is 40.
- Recommend having the target cluster running the same or a later version of OneFS
as the source cluster.
- After creating a policy and before running the policy for the first time, use the policy
assessment option to see how long it takes to scan the source cluster dataset with
default settings.
- Increase workers per node in cases where network utilization is low. This can help
overcome network latency by having more workers generate I/O on the wire. If
adding more workers per node does not improve network utilization, avoid adding
more workers because of diminishing returns and worker scheduling overhead.

Data management recommendations

## 37
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- Increase workers per node in datasets with many small files to push more files in
parallel. Ass more workers are employed, more CPU is consumed, due to other
cluster operations.
- Consider using SmartConnect pools to constrain replication to a dedicated set of
cluster network interfaces, and to avoid contention with other workflows accessing
the cluster through these nodes.
- Use SyncIQ network throttling to control how much network bandwidth SyncIQ can
consume.
- Avoid full dataset replications where possible. Changing any of the following
parameters will trigger a full baseline sync of the policy:
▪ Source path or paths: root path, include and exclude paths
▪ Source file selection criteria: type, time, and regular expressions
- With a policy of type Sync, modifying file attributes comparison options and values
causes a re-sync and deletion of any nonmatching files from the target next time
the job runs. This does not apply to policies of type Copy.
- Specifying file criteria in a SyncIQ policy will slow down a copy of sync job.
- Full baseline replication takes much longer than incremental synchronizations, so to
optimize performance, avoid triggering full synchronizations unless necessary.
Changing any of the following parameters will trigger a baseline sync of the policy:
▪ Source path or paths: root path, include and exclude paths
▪ Source file selection criteria: type, time, and regular expressions
▪ Remember that “target aware synchronizations” are much more CPU-intensive
than regular baseline replication. However, they potentially generate far less
network traffic if both source and target datasets are already seeded with
similar data.
▪ Setting a target cluster password is useful for security and to verify that the
source cluster is replicating to the correct target. The target cluster password is
different from a cluster’s root password. Do not specify a target password
unless you create the required password file on the target cluster.
- If a cluster is running OneFS 8.2 or later, use SyncIQ encryption to protect any
replication sessions that traverse WAN or other insecure or untrusted network
segments.
For more information, see the PowerScale SyncIQ white paper.
Data management recommendations

OneFS SmartQuotas tracks disk usage with reports and allows for the enforcement of
storage limits with alerts and hard boundaries. SmartQuotas consists of two types of
capacity quota:
- Accounting Quotas: Monitor and report on the amount of storage consumed, but do
not take any action.
Quota best
practices

Data management recommendations

38 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- Enforcement Quotas: Restrict how much storage that a user, group, or directory
can use and send notifications.
OneFS SmartQuotas can have one of four enforcement types:
- Hard:  A limit that cannot be exceeded.
- Soft:  A limit that can be exceeded until a grace period has expired.
- Advisory:  An informal limit that can be exceeded.
- None: No enforcement. Quota is accounting only.
All three quota types have both a limit, or threshold, and a grace period. A hard quota has
a zero-time grace period, an advisory quota has an infinite grace period, and a soft quota
has a configurable grace period.
Even when a hard quota limit is reached, there are certain instances where operations are
not blocked. These include administrative control by root (UID 0), system maintenance
activities, and the ability of a blocked user to free up space.

Figure 14. SmartQuotas usage overview
SmartQuotas best practices include:
- Avoid creating quotas on the root directory of the default OneFS share (/ifs). A root-
level quota may result in performance degradation.
- Where possible, observe the best practice of a maximum number of 500,000
quotas per cluster in OneFS 8.2 and later, and 20,000 quotas per cluster in prior
releases.
- Limit quota depth to a maximum of 275 directories.
- Governing a single directory with overlapping quotas can also degrade performance.
- Directory quotas can also be used to alert of and constrain runaway jobs,
preventing them from consuming massive amounts of storage space.
- Enforcement quotas are not recommended for snapshot-tracking quota domains.

Data management recommendations

## 39
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- Before using quota data for analysis or other purposes, verify that no QuotaScan
jobs are running.
- Rather than editing the quota email notification templates directly, copy them to
another directory to edit and deploy them.
- If quota reports are not in the default directory, you can run the ‘isi quota settings
reports view’ command to find the directory where they are stored.
- Use the ‘isi quota quotas notifications disable’ command to disable all notifications
for a quota.

Quota considerations include:
- The maximum tested quota limit is 400,000 (although the file system has no hard-
coded limit on quotas). However, when listing a large number of quotas, only a
partial list may be returned.
- With CloudPools data, the quota is calculated based on the size of the data local to
the cluster. For example, for a 100MB file tiered to a cloud provider, SmartQuotas
would calculate just the size of the local stub file (8K).
- SmartQuotas reports the logical capacity of the files, whether they are deduplicated
or not.
- The QuotaScan job runs after the creation of a quota, but not after a change.
However, it does run on a schedule and incorporates any changes then.
- If two quotas are created on the same directory – for example an accounting quota
without Snapshots and a hard quota with Snapshots - the quota without Snapshot
data overrules the limit from the quota with Snapshot data.
- SmartQuotas also provide a low impact way to provide directory file count reports.
- Configuration changes for linked quotas must be made on the parent quota that the
linked quota is inheriting from. Changes to the parent quota are propagated to all
children. To override configuration from the parent quota, you must unlink the quota
first.
- If a quota type uses the accounting-only option, enforcement limits cannot be used
for that quota.
- Cloned and deduplicated files are treated as ordinary files by quotas. If the quota
includes data protection overhead, the data protection overhead for shared data is
not included in the usage calculation.
- Moving quota directories across quota domains is not supported.
- You can edit or delete a quota report only when the quota is not linked to a default
quota.
- A quota can only be unlinked when it is linked to a default quota. Configuration
changes for linked quotas must be made on the parent (default) quota that the
linked quota is inheriting from. Changes to the parent quota are propagated to all
children. If you want to override configuration from the parent quota, you must first
unlink the quota.
## Quota
considerations

OneFS data reduction best practices

40 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- Disabling all quota notifications also disables all system notification behavior. Use
the --clear options to remove specific quota notification rules and fall back to the
system default.
- Quota containers compartmentalize /ifs, so that a directory with a container will
appear as its own separate ‘file system slice’.  For example, to configure a directory
quota with a 4TB container on /ifs/data/container1, you could use the following CLI
command:
# isi quota quotas create /ifs/data/container1 directory --
hard-threshold 4T --container true
Within OneFS, quota data is maintained in Quota Accounting Blocks (QABs). Each QAB
contains many Quota Accounting records, which need to be updated whenever a
particular user adds or removes data from a file system on which quotas are enabled. If
many clients are accessing the file system simultaneously, these blocks can become
highly contended and a potential bottleneck.
To address this issue, quota accounts have a mechanism to avoid hot spots on the nodes
storing QABs. Quota Account Constituents (QACs) help parallelize the quota accounting
by including additional QAB mirrors on other nodes.
The following sysctl increases the number of quota accounting constituents, which allows
for better scalability and reduces latencies on create/delete flurries when quotas are used.
Using this parameter, the internally calculated QAC count for each quota is multiplied by
the specified value. If a workflow experiences write performance issues, and it has many
writes to files or directories governed by a single quota, increasing the QAC ratio
(efs.quota.reorganize.qac_ratio) might improve write performance.
The QAC ration can be changed to value 8 from the default value of 1 by running the
following OneFS CLI command:
# isi_sysctl_cluster efs.quota.reorganize.qac_ratio=8
For more information, see the Storage Quota Management and Provisioning with Dell
PowerScale SmartQuotas white paper.
OneFS data reduction best practices

The OneFS data reduction portfolio consists of an array of several features, including
compression, deduplication, and small file efficiency. While these components all co-exist,
they are not universally supported across the full hardware platform portfolio. The
following table indicates which features are available on each PowerScale hardware
platform:
## Overview

OneFS data reduction best practices

Table 7. PowerScale platform features


The following decision tree can assist with identifying the available and appropriate data reduction features for
particular cluster configurations and datasets:

Figure 15. OneFS data reduction and storage efficiency decision tree

OneFS SmartDedupe maximizes the storage efficiency of a cluster by decreasing the amount of
physical storage required to house an organization’s data. Efficiency is achieved by scanning the
on-disk data for identical blocks and then eliminating the duplicates. This approach is commonly
referred to as post-process, or asynchronous, deduplication.
After duplicate blocks are discovered, SmartDedupe moves a single copy of those blocks to a
special set of files known as shadow stores. During this process, duplicate blocks are removed from
the actual files and replaced with pointers to the shadow stores.
SmartDedupe
best practices

OneFS data reduction best practices

42 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices

Figure 16. SmartDedupe capacity savings
For optimal cluster performance, we recommend the following SmartDedupe best
practices. Some of this information is discussed elsewhere in this paper.
- Deduplication is typically applied to datasets with a lower rate of change – for
example, file shares, home directories, and archive data.
- Enable SmartDedupe to run at subdirectory levels below /ifs.
- Avoid adding more than ten subdirectory paths to the SmartDedupe configuration
policy,
- SmartDedupe is ideal for home directories, departmental file shares, and warm and
cold archive datasets.
- Run SmartDedupe against a smaller sample dataset first to evaluate performance
impact against space efficiency.
- Schedule deduplication to run during the cluster’s low usage hours—overnight or
weekends. By default, the SmartDedupe job runs automatically.
- After the initial deduplication job has completed, schedule incremental
deduplication jobs to run every two weeks or so, depending on the size and rate of
change of the dataset.
- Always run SmartDedupe with the default ‘low’ impact Job Engine policy.
- Run the deduplication assessment job on a single root directory at a time. If
multiple directory paths are assessed in the same job, you will not be able to
determine which directory should be deduplicated.

OneFS data reduction best practices

## 43
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- When replicating deduplicated data, to avoid running out of space on target, verify
that the logical data size (the amount of storage space saved plus the actual
storage space consumed) does not exceed the total available space on the target
cluster.
Bear in mind that deduplication is not free. There is always trade-off between cluster
resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk), and the benefit of increased space
efficiency.

SmartDedupe considerations include:
- SmartDedupe will not share blocks across files with different protection policies
applied.
- OneFS metadata, including the deduplication index, is not deduplicated.
- SmartDedupe will not attempt to deduplicate files smaller than 32 KB in size.
- Dedupe job performance will typically improve significantly on the second and
subsequent job runs after the initial index and the bulk of the shadow stores have
already been created.
- SmartDedupe will not deduplicate the data stored in a snapshot. However,
snapshots can certainly be created of deduplicated data.
- If deduplication is enabled on a cluster that already has a significant amount of data
stored in snapshots, it will take time before deduplication affects the snapshot data.
Newly created snapshots will contain deduplicated data, but older snapshots will
not.
- SmartDedupe deduplicates common blocks within the same file, resulting in even
better data efficiency.
For more information, see the OneFS SmartDedupe white paper.

OneFS in-line data reduction is available exclusively on the PowerScale F910, F900,
F810, F710, F600, F210, F200, H700/7000, H5600, and A300/3000 platforms. The
OneFS architecture has the following principal components:
## • Data Reduction Platform
- Compression Engine and Chunk Map
- Zero block removal phase
- Deduplication In-memory Index and Shadow Store Infrastructure
- Data Reduction Alerting and Reporting Framework

OneFS data reduction best practices

44 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
If both in-line compression and deduplication are enabled on a cluster, zero block removal
is performed first, followed by deduplication, and then compression. This order allows
each phase to reduce the scope of work each subsequent phase.

Figure 17. In-line data reduction workflow
OneFS provides software-based compression for the F910, F900, F710, F600, F210,
F200, and H5600 platform, as fallback in the event of an F810 hardware failure, and in a
mixed cluster for use in nodes without a hardware offload capability. Both hardware and
software compression implementations are DEFLATE compatible.
The F810 platform includes a compression offload capability, with each node in an F810
chassis containing a Mellanox Innova-2 Flex Adapter. Thus, the Mellanox adapter
transparently performs compression and decompression with minimal latency, and avoids
the need for consuming a node’s expensive CPU and memory resources.
The OneFS hardware compression engine uses zlib, with a software implementation of
igzip as fallback in the event of a compression hardware failure. OneFS employs a
compression chunk size of 128 KB, with each chunk consisting of sixteen 8 KB data
blocks. This chunk size is optimal because it is the same size that OneFS uses for its data
protection stripe units, providing simplicity and efficiency, by avoiding the overhead of
additional chunk packing.

Figure 18. Compression chunks and OneFS transparent overlay
Consider the preceding diagram. After compression, this chunk is reduced from sixteen to
six 8 KB blocks in size, which means that this chunk is now physically 48 KB in size.
OneFS provides a transparent logical overlay to the physical attributes. This overlay
describes whether the backing data is compressed or not and which blocks in the chunk
are physical or sparse, such that file system consumers are unaffected by compression.
As such, the compressed chunk is logically represented as 128 KB in size, regardless of
its actual physical size.

OneFS data reduction best practices

## 45
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
Efficiency savings must be at least 8 KB (one block) in order for compression to occur,
otherwise that chunk or file will be passed over and remain in its original, uncompressed
state. For example, a file of 16 KB that yields 8 KB (one block) of savings would be
compressed. Once a file has been compressed, it is then FEC protected.
Compression chunks will never cross node pools. This avoids the need to decompress or
recompress data to change protection levels, perform recovered writes, or otherwise shift
protection-group boundaries.
For optimal cluster performance, we recommend the following in-line compression best
practices. Some of this information is provided elsewhere in this paper.
- In-line data reduction is for F910, F900, F810, F710, F600, F210, F200, and H5600
installations only. Legacy Isilon F800 nodes cannot be upgraded or converted to
F810 nodes.
- Run the assessment tool on a subset of the data to be compressed/deduplicated.
- When replicating compressed and/or deduplicated data, to avoid running out of
space on target, verify that the logical data size (the amount of storage space
saved plus the actual storage space consumed) does not exceed the total available
space on the target cluster.
- In general, additional capacity savings may not warrant the overhead of running
SmartDedupe on node pools with in-line deduplication enabled.
- Data reduction can be disabled on a cluster if the overhead of compression and
deduplication is considered too high and/or performance is impacted.
- The software data reduction fall back option is less performant, more resource
intensive, and less efficient (lower compression ratio) that hardware data reduction.
Consider removing F810 nodes with failing offload hardware from the node pool.
- Run the deduplication assessment job on a single root directory at a time. If
multiple directory paths are assessed in the same job, you will not be able to
determine which directory should be deduplicated.

In-line data reduction is supported with the following caveats:
- OneFS 8.2.1 will support 4 to 252 F810 nodes, or 36 chassis, per cluster.
- OneFS 8.2.2 will support 4 to 252 H5600 or F810 nodes per cluster.
- OneFS 9.0 will support 3 to 252 F600 or F200 nodes, or 4 to 252 H5600 or F810
nodes per cluster.
- OneFS 9.2 will support 3 to 252 F900, F600, or F200 nodes, or 4 to 252 H5600 or
F810 nodes per cluster.
- OneFS 9.2.1 and later will support 3 to 252 F900, F600, or F200s, or 4 to 252
F810, H700/7000, H5600, or A300/3000 nodes per cluster.
- OneFS 9.7 and later will support 3 to 252 F900, F710, F600, F210, or F200s, or 4
to 252 F810, H700/7000, H5600, or A300/3000 nodes per cluster.
- OneFS 9.8 and later will support 3 to 252 F910, F900, F710, F600, F210, or F200s,
or 4 to 252 F810, H700/7000, H5600, or A300/3000 nodes per cluster
In-line data
reduction
considerations

OneFS data reduction best practices

46 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
## • List Bullet 1
- Data reduction savings depend heavily on factors like the data, cluster composition,
and protection level.
- Compressed and deduplicated data does not exit the file system compressed or
deduplicated in any shape or form.
- Decompression is substantially less expensive than compression.
- In-line data reduction is exclusive to the PowerScale F910, F900, F810, F710,
F600, F210, F200, H700/7000, H5600, and A300/3000 nodes and does not require
a software license. In-line data reduction will be automatically disabled on any other
node pools.
- In OneFS 9.3 and earlier, in-line compression is automatically enabled on
supporting nodes, whereas in-line deduplication is disabled. The following
command-line syntax will activate in-line deduplication on a compression cluster:
‘isi dedupe inline settings modify –-mode enabled’
- In-line deduplication is enabled by default for new clusters running OneFS 9.4. For
earlier OneFS releases, in-line deduplication is disabled by default.
- There is no compatibility or equivalency between F800 and F810 nodes: They
cannot share the same node pool and the F800 nodes will not be able to store
compressed data.
- There is no OneFS WebUI support for data reduction. Configuration and
management are through the CLI only.
- Partial writes to compression chunks may require reading the entire compression
chunk first and decompressing it. This is true even if most of the compression
chunk is being written.
- Modifications to compression chunks may require rewriting the entire compression
chunk even if only a single logical block is changed.
- Some workloads will have data access patterns that exacerbate the above issues
and have the potential to cause more writes than if compression was not used.
- Data integrity failures with compressed data will likely mean that corruption does
not just affect a single block but instead the entire compression chunk.
- If SmartPools is used on a mixed cluster containing compression nodes, data will
only be compressed and/or in-line deduplicated when it physically resides on the
compression node pool or pools. If data is tiered to non-compression node pools, it
will be uncompressed on the compression nodes before it is moved, so full
uncompressed capacity will be required on the compressed pool.
- Post-process SmartDedupe can run in concert with compression and in-line
deduplication. It is supported but not widely used. The SmartDedupe job will have
to decompress data first to perform deduplication, which is an additional resource
expense.
- In-line compression on the F810 uses a dedicated backend network card, so F810
nodes will not support two-way NDMP back end through a Gen6 back-end Ethernet
or Fibre Channel controller.

OneFS data reduction best practices

## 47
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- Even though compressed files are unintelligible when stored on disk, this typically
does not satisfy encryption requirements. However, PowerScale nodes are
available with self-encrypting drives (SED) for secure data-at-rest compliance.
- As discussed earlier, in-line compression is not free. There is always a trade-off
between cluster resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk), the potential for data
fragmentation and the benefit of increased space efficiency.
- Since compression extends the capacity of a cluster, it also has the effect of
reducing the per-TB compute resource ratio (CPU, memory, I/O).
- Depending on an application’s I/O profile and the effect of In-line data reduction on
the data layout, read and write performance and overall space savings can vary
considerably.
- OneFS metadata structures (inodes, b-trees) are not compressed.
- Since compression trades cluster performance for storage capacity savings,
compression may not be ideally suited for heavily accessed data, or high-
performance workloads.
- SmartFlash (L3) caching is not applicable to F-series nodes since they contain
exclusively SSD flash media anyway.
- If a heterogeneous cluster contains PowerScale F910, F900, F810, F710, F600,
F210, F200, H700/7000, H5600, or A300/3000 chassis plus other nodes that do not
support in-line data reduction, data will be uncompressed as it moves between
pools. A non-compression node on the cluster can be an initiator for compressed
writes to a compression pool and will perform compression in software. However,
this may generate significant overhead for lower powered Archive class nodes.
- In-line deduplication will not permit block sharing across different hardware types or
node pools to reduce the risk of performance asymmetry.
- In-line deduplication will not share blocks across files with different protection
policies applied.
- OneFS metadata is not deduplicated.
- In-line deduplication will not deduplicate the data stored in a snapshot.
- There is no in-line deduplication of CloudPools files.
- In-line deduplication can deduplicate common blocks within the same file and a
sequence of consecutive blocks to a single block in a shadow store, resulting in
even better data efficiency.
For more information, see the in-line data reduction white paper.

Data immutability recommendations

48 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
Data immutability recommendations
SmartLock offers advanced data immutability and security capabilities, such as the
protection of directories and files from deletion in a WORM state, the ability to disable
privileged delete, and overall security. It is available in two different modes: Compliance
and Enterprise. The administrative restrictions of Compliance mode have the potential to
affect both compliance data as well as enterprise data. formed Consider the following
guidelines and suggested best practices:
- Use SmartLock in Compliance mode only if your organization is legally obligated to
do so under SEC rule 17-a4(f). As the Compliance mode installation or upgrade
involves careful planning and preparation, it is recommended to be done with the
assistance of Dell Support.
- Enterprise mode offers more than adequate security requirements for most users,
in most situations. Moreover, the ‘superuser’ account remains available in
Enterprise mode. Therefore, it is more administrator friendly compared to
Compliance mode. Following are the best practices that need to be performed
before putting an existing cluster in Compliance mode.
- Test and validate all workflows using a proof-of-concept Compliance mode cluster.
- Verify that the cluster time is correct before putting the cluster in Compliance mode.
- Avoid using ‘run-as-root’ on SMB shares. If you have previously configured SMB
shares to ‘run-as-root’ then change the settings for those shares to specify access
permissions to either ‘Full-Control’, ‘Read-Write’ or ‘Read’ before putting the cluster
in Compliance mode.
- Use Role based access control (RBAC) for cluster access to perform file
management and administrative operations. Enable RBAC, grant appropriate
privileges, and then log in through the RBAC-enabled account to the command-line
interface (CLI). ‘compadmin’ represents a regular data user in the context of the
## CLI.
- For any data migrations from a non-Compliance mode cluster to a cluster that you
intend to put in Compliance mode, first verify that current ownership and access
permissions are valid and appropriate on both clusters to allow data migration.
- Review the permissions and ownership of any files that exclusively permit the root
account to manage or write data to them. Once an upgrade to Compliance mode is
complete, if the existing OneFS configuration limits relevant POSIX access
permissions to specific directories or files in any way, writing data or changing
ownership of these objects will be blocked.
- If any root-owned workflow or datafiles exist, all ownership or permission changes
should be performed before upgrading to Compliance mode. You should not
change the ownership of any system files. The Compliance mode conversion
process automates all required ownership changes to system files. Avoid changing
the ownership of any files outside of /ifs, as no user data should reside outside of
/ifs. As a best practice, change the ownership of files under /ifs that are owned by
‘root’ to the ‘compadmin’ account before upgrading to Compliance mode.
- In Compliance mode, the default POSIX permissions permit the compadmin
account to write data. However, the following directories should not be modified

Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
unless the default permissions for these directories have been changed: /ifs/.ifsvar
and /ifs/.snapshot
- Verify the available disaster recovery options on Compliance mode clusters in
relation to SyncIQ.
- If NDMP is being used for backups, the NDMP backups of SmartLock Compliance
data are not considered to be compliant with the SEC regulation 17-a4f.
For more information, see the SmartLock white paper.
OneFS security hardening
OneFS provides a hardened profile that can be enabled for sites that are looking for
additional security or need to comply with the US Department of Defense’s Security
Technical Implementation Guide (STIG). This profile can be enabled or disabled on a
cluster as required but does require a zero-cost license to activate.
OneFS 9.5 introduces several additional security enhancements that satisfy Defense
Information Systems Agency (DISA) and other federal and corporate security mandates
and requirements, including:
- Multifactor authentication (MFA) through access cards (CAC and PIV), single sign-
on (SSO) through SAML for the WebUI, and PKI-based authentication
- FIPS 140-2 data-in-flight encryption for major protocols, FIPS 140-2 data at rest
through SEDs, SEDs master key rekey, and TLS 1.2 support
- Introduction of a host-based firewall, permitting restriction of the management
interface to a dedicated subnet and hosts to specified IP pools
- IPV6-only network support for the USGv6R1 standard
Permissions, authentication, and access control
recommendations
Multi-tenant Access Zones provide secure, isolated storage pools for specific departments
within an organization, allowing consolidation of storage resources without compromising
security.
A minimum of two AD, LDAP or NIS servers provides redundancy and helps avoid access
control lookups being a bottleneck. For larger environments, scaling the number of
domain servers may be required.
The best practices for Multi-tenant Access Zones include:
- The number of multi-tenant access zones should not exceed 50. The number of
local users and groups per cluster should not exceed 25,000 for each. While
possible, creating a larger number of local groups and/or users may affect system
performance.
- Separate corporate tenants with multi-tenant access zones, up to a maximum of 50
zones.
- Use the system multi-tenant access zone for cluster management.

Job Engine recommendations

50 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- Constrain different protocols (for example, NFS, SMB) to separate multi-tenant
access zones.
- If you create multi-tenant access zones, ensure that the directory paths for each
zone under /ifs do not overlap. Instead, you should designate separate directory
trees for each zone.
- As part of SmartConnect’s support for multitenancy, Groupnet objects sit above
subnets and pools and allow separate multi-tenant access zones to contain distinct
DNS settings.
For more information about identity management, authentication, and access control in
combined NFS and SMB environments, see the OneFS Multiprotocol Security Guide.
Job Engine recommendations

In a clustered architecture, there are cluster jobs that are responsible for taking care of the
health and maintenance of the cluster itself—these jobs are all managed by the OneFS
Job Engine. The Job Engine runs across the entire cluster and reduces a task into smaller
work items. It then allocates these items to multiple worker threads on each node. Jobs
are typically run as background tasks across the cluster, using spare or especially
reserved capacity and resources. The jobs themselves can be categorized into three
primary classes, as described in File system maintenance jobs, Feature support jobs, and
User action jobs.

File system maintenance jobs perform background file system maintenance and typically
require access to all nodes. These jobs are required to run in default configurations, and
often in degraded cluster conditions. Examples include file system protection and drive
rebuilds.

Feature support jobs perform work that facilitates some extended storage management
function, and typically only run when the feature has been configured. Examples include
deduplication and anti-virus scanning.

Storage administrators run user action jobs directly to accomplish some data
management goal. Examples include parallel tree deletes and permissions maintenance.
The Job Engine allows up to three jobs to be run simultaneously. This concurrent job
process is governed by the following criteria:
- Job priority.
- Exclusion sets—These jobs cannot run together (FlexProtect and AutoBalance).
- Cluster health—Most jobs cannot run when the cluster is in a degraded state.

Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices

Figure 19. Job Engine exclusion sets
The default, global limit of three jobs does not include jobs for striping or marking; one job
from each of those categories can also run concurrently.
For optimal cluster performance, we recommend observing the following Job Engine best
practices.
- Schedule jobs to run during the cluster’s low usage hours—overnight, weekends.
- Where possible, use the default priority, impact, and scheduling settings for each
job.
- To complement the four default impact profiles, create additional profiles such as
“daytime_medium”, “after_hours_medium”, “weekend_medium”, to fit specific
environment needs.
- Ensure the cluster, including any individual node pools, is less than 90% full, so
performance is not impacted and that there is always space to reprotect data in the
event of drive failures. Also enable virtual hot spare (VHS) to reserve space in case
you need to smartfail devices. The best practice is to configure a 10% VHS reserve.
- Configure and pay attention to alerts. Set up event notification rules so that you will
be notified when the cluster begins to reach capacity thresholds. Make sure to enter
a current email address to ensure you receive the notifications.
- It is recommended not to disable the snapshot delete job. In addition to preventing
unused disk space from being freed, disabling the snapshot delete job can cause
performance degradation.

Job Engine recommendations

52 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- Delete snapshots in order, beginning with the oldest. Do not delete snapshots from
the middle of a time range. Newer snapshots are mostly pointers to older
snapshots, and they look larger than they really are.
- If you need to delete snapshots and there are down or smartfailed devices on the
cluster, or the cluster is in an otherwise “degraded protection” state, contact Dell
Technical Support for assistance.
- Only run the FSAnalyze job if you are using InsightIQ and/or require file system
analytics. FSAnalyze creates data for InsightIQ file system analytics tools, providing
details about data properties and space usage within /ifs. Unlike SmartQuotas,
FSAnalyze only updates its views when the FSAnalyze job runs. Because
FSAnalyze is a relatively low-priority job, higher-priority jobs can sometimes
preempt it, so it can take a long time to gather all the data.
- Schedule deduplication jobs to run every 10 days or so, depending on the size of
the dataset.
- SmartDedupe will automatically run with a “low-impact” Job Engine policy.
However, this policy can be manually reconfigured.
- In a heterogeneous cluster, tune job priorities and impact policies to the level of the
lowest performance tier.
- Before running a major (non-rolling) OneFS upgrade, allow active jobs to complete,
where possible, and cancel out any outstanding running jobs.
- Before running TreeDelete, ensure there are no quotas policies set on any
directories under the root level of the data for deletion. TreeDelete cannot delete a
directory if a quota has been applied to it.
- If FlexProtect is running, allow it to finish completely before powering down any
nodes or the entire cluster. While shutting down the cluster during restripe will not
hurt anything directly, it does increase the risk of a second device failure before
FlexProtect finishes reprotecting data.
- When using metadata read or metadata write acceleration, always run a job with
the *LIN suffix where possible. For example, favor the FlexProtectLIN job, rather
than the regular FlexProtect job.
- TreeDelete can delete a directory to which a quota has been applied using the ‘--
delete-quota’ flag. For example: #isi job start TreeDelete --paths=/ifs/quota –delete
quota
- Avoid data movement as much as possible during daily operations. SmartPools
data placement requires resources which can contend with client IO. With a mixed
node cluster where data tiering is required, the recommendation is to schedule the
SmartPools job to run during off-hours (nights and/or weekends) when the client
activity is at its lowest.

For optimal cluster performance, bear in mind the following OneFS Job Engine
considerations:
- When reconfiguring the default priority, schedule, and impact profile for a job,
consider the following questions:
▪ What resources am I impacting?
## Job Engine
considerations

Job Engine recommendations

## 53
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
▪ What would I be gaining or loosing if I reprioritized this job?
▪ What are my impact options and their respective benefits and drawbacks?
▪ How long will the job run and what other jobs will it contend with?
- SyncIQ, the OneFS replication product, does not use Job Engine. However, it has
both influenced, and been strongly influenced by, the Job Engine design. SyncIQ
also terms its operations "jobs," and its processes and terminology bear some
similarity to Job Engine. The Job Engine impact management framework is aware
of the resources consumed by SyncIQ, in addition to client load, and will throttle
jobs accordingly.
- A job with a name suffixed by ‘Lin’, for example FlexProtectLin, indicates that this
job will scan an SSD-based copy of the LIN tree metadata, rather than access the
hard drives themselves. This can significantly improve job performance, depending
on the specific workflow.
- When more than three jobs with the same priority level and no exclusion set
restrictions are scheduled to run simultaneously, the three jobs with the lowest job
ID value will run. The remainder will be paused.
- There is only one ‘mark cookie’ available for marking jobs. So, if marking job A is
interrupted by another marking job B, job A will automatically be cancelled when it
resumes after the completion of B.
- For mixed node (heterogeneous) clusters that do not have a license for SmartPools
data tiering module, the SetProtectPlus job will run instead, and apply the default
file policy. SetProtectPlus will be automatically disabled if a valid SmartPools
license key is added to the cluster.
- By default, FlexProtect is the only job allowed to run if a cluster is in degraded
mode. Other jobs will automatically be paused and will not resume until FlexProtect
has completed and the cluster is healthy again.
- Restriping jobs only block each other when the current phase might perform
restriping. This is most evident with MultiScan, whose final phase only sweeps
rather than restripes. Similarly, MediaScan, which rarely ever restripes, is can
usually run to completion more often without contending with other restriping jobs.
- MediaScan restripes in phases 3 and 5 of the job, and only if there are disk errors
(ECCs) which require data reprotection. If MediaScan reaches its third phase with
ECCs, it will pause until AutoBalanceLin is no longer running. If MediaScan's
priority were in the range 1-3, it would cause AutoBalanceLin to pause instead.
- If two jobs happen to reach their restriping phases simultaneously and the jobs
have different priorities, the higher priority job (priority value closer to “1”) will
continue to run, and the other will pause. If the two jobs have the same priority, the
job that is already in its restriping phase will continue to run, and the job newly
entering its restriping phase will pause.
- During MediaScan’s verify and repair phases, attempts to re-read bad sectors can
occasionally cause drives to stall briefly while trying to correct the error. This
interruption is typically brief and limited.
For more information, see the PowerScale OneFS Job Engine white paper.

Cluster management recommendations

54 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
Cluster management recommendations

There are three access methods for configuring and administering a OneFS powered
cluster:
- Command-line interface (CLI) - either by SSH or serial console.
- Web interface (WebUI)
- RESTful platform API (PAPI)
OneFS 9.0 and later provide Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) support for
Isilon Gen6 and PowerScale platforms. This functionality allows out-of-band console
access and remote node power control over a dedicated Ethernet management port and
is configured and managed using the ‘isi ipmi’ CLI command set.
While the Web Interface is the most intuitive, menu driven, and simple to use cluster
administration method, it is also the most limited in terms of scope. The CLI has a more
comprehensive set of administrative commands that the WebUI, making it a popular
choice for OneFS power users.
However, where possible, use scripts to automate management of the cluster through the
platform API.  Using scripts also avoids challenges with the CLI and WebUI in parsing
large numbers of configuration policies—for example, tens of thousands of NFS exports.

When a cluster or any of its node pools becomes more than 95% full, OneFS can
experience slower performance and possible workflow interruptions in degraded mode
and high-transaction or write latency sensitive operations. Furthermore, when a large
cluster approaches full capacity (over 98% full), the following issues can occur:
- Performance degradation in some cases
- Workflow disruptions - failed file operations and inability to write data.
- Inability to make configuration changes or run commands to delete data and free up
space
- Increased disk and node rebuild times.
To ensure that a cluster or its constituent pools do not run out of space:
- Add new nodes to existing clusters or pools
- Replace smaller-capacity nodes with larger-capacity nodes
- Create more clusters.
When deciding to add new nodes to an existing large cluster or pool, contact your sales
team to order the nodes well in advance of the cluster or pool running short on space. The
recommendation is to start planning for additional capacity when the cluster or pool
reaches 75% full. This will allow sufficient time to receive and install the new hardware,
while still maintaining sufficient free space.
The following table presents a suggested timeline for cluster capacity planning:
## Cluster
configuration
and
administration

Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
Table 8. Capacity planning timeline
Used capacity Action
75% Plan additional node purchases.
80% Receive delivery of the new hardware.
85% Rack and install the new node or nodes.

If an organization’s data availability and protection SLA varies across different data
categories (for example, home directories, file services), ensure that any snapshot,
replication, and backup schedules are configured accordingly to meet the required
availability and recovery objectives, and fit within the overall capacity plan.
Consider configuring a separate accounting quota for /ifs/home and /ifs/data directories
(or wherever data and home directories are provisioned) to monitor aggregate disk space
usage and issue administrative alerts as necessary to avoid running low on overall
capacity.
For optimal performance in any size cluster, the recommendation is to maintain 10% free
space in each pool of a cluster.
To better protect smaller clusters (containing 3 to 7 nodes) we recommend that you
maintain 15 to 20% free space. A full smartfail of a node in smaller clusters may require
more than one node's worth of space. Maintaining 15 to 20% free space can allow the
cluster to continue to operate while Dell helps with recovery plans.
Plan for contingencies: having a fully updated backup of your data can limit the risk of
data loss if a node fails.
Maintaining appropriate protection levels
Ensure that your cluster and pools are protected at the appropriate level. Every time you
add nodes, re-evaluate protection levels. OneFS includes a ‘suggested protection’
function that calculates a recommended protection level based on cluster configuration,
and alerts you if the cluster falls below this suggested level.
OneFS supports several protection schemes. These include the ubiquitous +2d:1n, which
protects against two drive failures or one node failure.
The best practice is to use the recommended protection level for a particular cluster
configuration. This recommended level of protection is clearly marked as ‘suggested’ in
the OneFS WebUI storage pools configuration pages and is typically configured by
default. For current hardware configurations, the recommended protection level is
generally ‘+2d:1n’, ‘+3d:1n1d’, or ‘+4n:2d’ depending on the cluster size.

Cluster management recommendations

56 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices

Figure 20. OneFS suggested protection level
Monitoring cluster capacity
To monitor cluster capacity:
Configure alerts. Set up event notification rules so that you will be notified when the
cluster begins to reach capacity thresholds. Make sure to enter a current email address in
order to receive the notifications.
Monitor alerts. The cluster sends notifications when any of its node pools have reached
90 percent and 97 percent capacity. On some clusters, 5 percent (or even 1 percent)
capacity remaining might mean that a lot of space is still available, so you might be
inclined to ignore these notifications. However, it is best to pay attention to the alerts,
closely monitor the cluster, and have a plan in place to take action when necessary.
Monitor ingest rate. It is very important to understand the rate at which data is coming
into the cluster or pool. Options to do this include:
## • SNMP
- SmartQuotas
- FSAnalyze
Use SmartQuotas to monitor and enforce administrator-defined storage limits.
SmartQuotas manages storage use, monitors disk storage, and issues alerts when disk
storage limits are exceeded. Although it does not provide the same detail of the file

Cluster management recommendations

## 57
Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
system that FSAnalyze does, SmartQuotas maintains a real-time view of space utilization
so that you can quickly obtain the information you need.
Run FSAnalyze jobs. FSAnalyze is a job-engine job that the system runs to create data
for InsightIQ file system analytics tools. FSAnalyze provides details about data properties
and space usage within the /ifs directory. Unlike SmartQuotas, FSAnalyze updates its
views only when the FSAnalyze job runs. Since FSAnalyze is a relatively low-priority job,
higher-priority jobs can sometimes preempt it, so it can take a long time to gather all the
data. An InsightIQ license is required to run an FSAnalyze job.
Managing data
Regularly archive data that is rarely accessed and delete any unused and unwanted data.
Ensure that pools do not become too full by setting up file pool policies to move data to
other tiers and pools.
Provisioning additional capacity
To ensure that your cluster or pools do not run out of space, you can create more
clusters, replace smaller-capacity nodes with larger-capacity nodes, or add new nodes to
existing clusters or pools. If you decide to add new nodes to an existing cluster or pool,
contact your sales representative to order the nodes long before the cluster or pool runs
out of space. Dell recommends that you begin the ordering process when the cluster or
pool reaches 80% used capacity. This will allow enough time to receive and install the
new equipment and still maintain enough free space.
Managing snapshots
Sometimes a cluster has many old snapshots that take up a lot of space. Reasons for this
include inefficient deletion schedules, degraded cluster preventing job execution, and
expired SnapshotIQ license.
Ensuring all nodes are supported and compatible
Each version of OneFS supports only certain nodes. See the “OneFS and node
compatibility” section of the Supportability and Compatibility Guide for a list of which
nodes are compatible with each version of OneFS. When upgrading OneFS, make sure
that the new version supports your existing nodes. If it does not, you might need to
replace the nodes.
Space and performance are optimized when all nodes in a pool are compatible. When you
add new nodes to a cluster, OneFS automatically provisions nodes into pools with other
nodes of compatible type, hard drive capacity, SSD capacity, and RAM. Occasionally,
however, the system might put a node into an unexpected location. If you believe that a
node has been placed into a pool incorrectly, contact Dell Technical Support for
assistance. Different versions of OneFS have different rules regarding what makes nodes
compatible.
## Enabling Virtual Hot Spare
The purpose of Virtual Hot Spare (VHS) is to keep space in reserve in case you need to
smartfail drives when the cluster gets close to capacity. Enabling VHS will not give you
more free space, but it will help protect your data in the event that space becomes scarce.
VHS is enabled by default. Dell strongly recommends that you do not disable VHS unless
directed by a Support engineer. If you disable VHS in order to free some space, the space

Cluster management recommendations

58 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
you just freed will probably fill up again quickly with new writes. At that point, if a drive
were to fail, you might not have enough space to smartfail the drive and reprotect its data,
potentially leading to data loss. If VHS is disabled and you upgrade OneFS, VHS will
remain disabled. If VHS is disabled on your cluster, first check to make sure the cluster
has enough free space to safely enable VHS, and then enable it. The recommendation is
to configure VHS with ‘at least 10% of total storage’, as illustrated in figure 21 below.
## Enabling Spillover
Spillover allows data that is being sent to a full pool to be diverted to an alternate pool.
Spillover is enabled by default on clusters that have more than one pool. If you have a
SmartPools license on the cluster, you can disable Spillover. However, it is recommended
that you keep Spillover enabled. If a pool is full and Spillover is disabled, you might get a
“no space available” error but still have a large amount of space left on the cluster.

Figure 21. OneFS SmartPools VHS and Spillover configuration
Confirm that:
- There are no cluster issues.
- OneFS configuration is as expected.
In summary, best practices on planning and managing capacity on a cluster include the
following:
- Maintain sufficient free space.
- Plan for contingencies.
- Manage your data:
▪ Maintain appropriate protection levels.
▪ Monitor cluster capacity and data ingest rate.

- Manage snapshots.
- Use InsightIQ, ClusterIQ, and MetadataIQ for usage forecasting, file system
analytics, and cluster health verification.
Best practices checklist
For optimal cluster performance, we recommend observing the following best practices.
This information might be discussed elsewhere in this paper.
- Define, implement, and regularly test a data protection strategy and business
continuity plan.
- Maintain sufficient free space and pay attention to data ingest rate.
- Ensure that cluster capacity utilization (hard drive and SSD) remains below 90%.
- For OneFS 9.2.1 and later, the recommendation is that each node in a PowerScale
cluster has a minimum of 64 GB of RAM.
- If SmartPools is licensed, ensure that spillover is enabled (default setting).
- Manage your data: Archive infrequently accessed data and delete unused data.
- Maintain appropriate data protection levels.
- Periodically check the data protection level as the cluster grows.
- Record your original settings before making any configuration changes to OneFS or
its data services.
- Monitor cluster capacity and data ingest rate.
- Ensure that all the data services that you want are licensed and configured.
- Observe NFS and SMB connection limits.
- Many cluster configuration settings are global and have cluster-wide effects. If you
consider changing cluster-wide configuration settings, be sure that you fully
understand the global settings and their implications
- Manage snapshot creation and deletion schedules.
- Set up SmartConnect for load balancing and use Round Robin as the balancing
policy.
- Recommend turning off client DNS caching, where possible. To handle client
requests properly, SmartConnect requires that clients use the latest DNS entries.
- Ensure that Virtual Hot Spare and SmartPools spillover both remain enabled (the
default).
- Ensure the SmartPools job only runs during off-hours.

## Summary

60 Dell PowerScale OneFS: Best Practices
- If using SmartPools tiering, reconfigure the Storage Target field from “anywhere” to
a specific tier or node pool to direct ingest to a performance node pool or tier.
- Add cluster to an InsightIQ monitoring instance
- Deploy a lab cluster environment to test and validate any new cluster configurations
before making changes that affect the production environment.
- Confirm that remote support functions work correctly through Dell Technologies
Connectivity Services or Secure Remote Services and internal email/SNMP
notifications.
- Upgrade OneFS to a newer release at least once a year using the nondisruptive
‘rolling-upgrade’ option.
- Configure and pay attention to cluster events and alerts.
- Regularly run and monitor OneFS Healthchecks.
## Summary
